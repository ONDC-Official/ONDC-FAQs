- question: What are STATIC_TERMS inside a payment object?
  answer: 'This will be the URL of a web page where the standard Terms and Conditions of the Network Participant - which are not covered in the API Specification (e.g.: indemnity) - will be hosted. These terms will apply to the transaction, in addition to the terms decided through the ONDC Protocol. If there is a conflict between the terms decided through the Protocol, and the Static Terms, the terms decided through the ONDC Protocol will prevail. Also, if there is a conflict between the Static Terms and the ONDC Network Policy or the Static Terms and the Network Participant Agreement, the terms of the ONDC Network Policy or the Network Participant Agreement (as the case may be) will prevail.'

- question: Who can procure logistics services and how?
  answer: Logistics Service Providers (LSPs) directly engage with sellers, who function as logistics buyers. Retail sellers then call action API requests to the logistics service providers and receive corresponding on_action responses from them. Additionally, the buyer app also has the capability to procure logistics services.

- question: Why is there no select and on-select call in the logistics contract?
  answer: |-
    There's no "select and on select" process because once the retail buyer builds a cart (in /select call), the seller app starts searching for logistics service providers to fulfil the order. LSPs send their catalog of available options through /on_search. Logistics buyer which is also the retail seller then goes ahead with one of the LSP and cascades back the delivery charges in /on_select of the retail contract. Therefore when the buyer app sends the/ init request, the logistics buyer also initialises the logistics order with the chosen LSP. From then on, all subsequent calls are cascaded. 

    B. For standalone logistic implementation api calls will be as per logistic api contract search /search

- question: What are the different types of delivery options available?
  answer: |-
    Below are the Delivery options: 1. Express Delivery Mode: By air Applicable for: P2H2P (Point to Hub to Person) Explanation:
     This is the fastest delivery method. Goods are transported by air from the pickup point to a hub and then delivered to the final destination. Best suited for time-sensitive shipments. 2. Standard Delivery Mode: By surface Applicable for: P2P (Point toPoint) and P2H2P Explanation:
     A common and cost-effective option using surface transport. Slower than air, but suitable for shipments that are not extremely time-sensitive. Can be used for both direct point-to-point and hub-based delivery models. 3. Immediate Delivery Time Limit: S2D (Search to Delivery) ≤ 60 minutes Explanation:
     Ultra-fast delivery, typically for hyperlocal services. The entire order—from request to drop—is completed in under 60 minutes. 4. Same-Day Delivery Explanation:
     The item is delivered on the same calendar day the order is placed. 5. Next-Day Delivery Explanation:
     The item is delivered the day after the order is placed.

- question: What is the "Return" fulfillment type, and when is it used?
  answer: The "Return" fulfillment type is a crucial aspect of the ONDC network's order management process, specifically designed to handle return requests from buyers. It is used when a buyer wishes to return one or more items from a previously delivered order. A "Return" fulfillment is created when a buyer initiates a return request for one or more items within the defined return window of the purchased items. This return window is specified in the product catalog.

- question: What is the item descriptor code P2P and P2H2P?
  answer: P2P stands for point-to-point and P2H2P stands for point-to-hub-to-point. These codes indicate the type of shipment. P2P is used for hyperlocal deliveries where the rider delivers the package directly from the pickup location to the drop-off location. P2H2P is used for intercity deliveries where the package is routed through a hub. P2H2P fulfillments require different packaging and an Air Waybill (AWB) number. This information is required for merchants to decide on the packaging required for shipment. /on_search

- question: What is the payment object in the Init call?
  answer: In the /init call, the payment object specifies the payment method and the entity responsible for collecting payment from the end buyer, along with settlement details. If "collected_by" is BPP, the logistics service provider will handle payment collection, as seen in Cash on Delivery (COD) transactions. Within the settlement_details, information regarding the party with whom the payment needs to be settled will be provided. If the payment mode is "ON_ORDER", the Buyer App (BAP) will collect payment from the buyer. In this scenario, the Logistics Service Provider (LSP) will provide their details in on_Init call for the settlement of the delivery charges.

- question: How do cancellation terms vary based on fulfilment state?
  answer: Cancellation terms can differ based on the fulfilment state. Various stages of fulfilment may result in distinct cancellation fees or penalties. For example, cancelling an order while it's in a pending state may or may not involve any cancellation charges. However, once an agent is assigned or the order is picked up, cancellation charges may be incurred upon cancelling the order.

  answer: Test case scenario for B2C Link:- Q. After which retail API we can initiate a search request to logistics. Once the order is selected by the end user (buyer) in the /select call, the retail seller — now acting as the LBNP — can initiate the /search call to the LSP. Q. When can we initiate a search call for logistics? The /search call must be initiated by the LBNP (buyer) and sent to the gateway URL. The gateway will then broadcast this request to all sellers who can service the item or are available in the specified area. Below are the Gateway URL for each environment:- Staging:- https://staging.gateway.proteantech.in/search Pre-Production:- https://preprod.gateway.ondc.org/search Production:- Q. What does @ondc/org/payload_details tags defines @ondc/org/payload_details specifies the length, breadth, height, and overall dimensions of the packages to be delivered. It also includes the actual item price and its category, indicating whether the item is classified as a dangerous good or not. Q. What is forward and backward shippment? A forward shipment refers to the process where the logistics buyer (LBNP) provides both the pickup (start) and drop-off (end) locations to facilitate the delivery of an order to the end customer. This is the standard flow for delivering a product once an order is placed. On the other hand, a reverse shipment (also known as a backward shipment or return to origin - RTO) occurs when the end customer refuses to accept the order, cancels it after dispatch, or initiates a return for any reason (e.g., damaged item, incorrect product, or no longer needed). In such cases, the logistics provider is responsible for picking up the product from the customer's location and returning it to the original seller's location or warehouse.

- question: What is RTO initiated and RTO Disposed?
  answer: RTO (Return to Origin) is a key part of the order fulfillment lifecycle and involves multiple stages. Two critical states in this process are "RTO-Initiated" and "RTO-Delivered" or "RTO-Disposed". RTO-Initiated This state marks the beginning of the return-to-origin process. It is triggered when the forward delivery attempt fails due to reasons such as recipient refusal, an undeliverable address, or other valid causes. At this point, the item is prepared for return to its original pickup location. The timestamp recorded in this state represents the official start of the RTO process. The location typically reflects the last delivery attempt location, where the delivery failed. RTO-Delivered / RTO-Disposed These states indicate the closure of the RTO cycle. RTO-Delivered signifies that the item has been successfully returned to the original pickup location. The timestamp for this state marks the completion of the return journey. The associated location is usually the seller's warehouse or the origin point of the shipment. RTO-Disposed indicates that the item has been discarded instead of being returned. This usually applies to goods that are perishable, damaged, or otherwise not fit for return. The timestamp here marks the completion of the disposal process, and the location corresponds to where the item was disposed of. Q. On which call RTO can be initiated? RTO can be initiated in an unsolicited / solicited /on_cancel event. In such cases, a return (RTO) fulfillment entry will be added immediately after the original delivery fulfillment within the fulfillments array. This RTO fulfillment will include a timestamp indicating when the return process was initiated.

- question: Is it possible to have only cascaded logistics flow with retail?
  answer: Both cascaded and uncascaded logistics flows are possible. In a typical cascaded flow, a retail buyer selects items in the cart, and the Logistics Buyer (LBNP) searches for a logistics service provider (LSP) to fulfill the order. It receives multiple catalogs and initiates the logistics order with one of the LSPs. After the buyer confirms the order, LBNP confirms the logistics order. However, there is a possibility that the chosen LSP may delay pickup or cancel the order after confirmation. In such cases, LBNP can cancel the logistics order, cascading it back so that the seller can cancel the retail order. Alternatively, LBNP can search for another LSP and confirm the order with them. Non cascaded flow is independent logistics flow. Where an independent logistics buyer wants to buy logistics, and it should be implemented as per contract api calls.
