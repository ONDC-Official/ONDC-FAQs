- question: What are STATIC_TERMS inside a payment object?
  answer: 'This will be the URL of a web page where the standard Terms and Conditions
    of the Network Participant - which are not covered in the API Specification (e.g.:
    indemnity) - will be hosted. These terms will apply to the transaction, in addition
    to the terms decided through the ONDC Protocol. If there is a conflict between
    the terms decided through the Protocol, and the Static Terms, the terms decided
    through the ONDC Protocol will prevail. Also, if there is a conflict between the
    Static Terms and the ONDC Network Policy or the Static Terms and the Network Participant
    Agreement, the terms of the ONDC Network Policy or the Network Participant Agreement
    (as the case may be) will prevail.'

- question: Who can procure logistics services and how?
  answer: Logistics Service Providers (LSPs) directly engage with sellers, who function
    as logistics buyers. Retail sellers then call action API requests to the logistics
    service providers and receive corresponding on_action responses from them. Additionally,
    the buyer app also has the capability to procure logistics services.

- question: Why is there no select and on-select call in the logistics contract?
  answer: "There's no \"select and on select\" process because once the retail buyer\
    \ builds a cart (in /select call), the seller app starts searching for logistics\
    \ service providers to fulfil the order. LSPs send their catalog of available\
    \ options through /on_search. Logistics buyer which is also the retail seller\
    \ then goes ahead with one of the LSP and cascades back the delivery charges in\
    \ /on_select of the retail contract. Therefore when the buyer app sends the/ init\
    \ request, the logistics buyer also initialises the logistics order with the chosen\
    \ LSP. From then on, all subsequent calls are cascaded. \n\nB. For standalone\
    \ logistic implementation api calls will be as per logistic api contract search\
    \ /search"

- question: What is the "Return" fulfillment type, and when is it used?
  answer: The "Return" fulfillment type is a crucial aspect of the ONDC network's
    order management process, specifically designed to handle return requests from
    buyers. It is used when a buyer wishes to return one or more items from a previously
    delivered order. A "Return" fulfillment is created when a buyer initiates a return
    request for one or more items within the defined return window of the purchased
    items. This return window is specified in the product catalog.

    process. A prepaid payment system for logistics can be facilitated through a payment
    wallet managed by the Logistics Service Provider (LSP) on behalf of the Logistics
    Buyer Network Partner (LBNP).

    Payment wallet can be used when you want LBNP to pay at the confirmation of the
    order and not later.'

  answer: P2P stands for point-to-point and P2H2P stands for point-to-hub-to-point.
    These codes indicate the type of shipment. P2P is used for hyperlocal deliveries
    where the rider delivers the package directly from the pickup location to the
    drop-off location. P2H2P is used for intercity deliveries where the package is
    routed through a hub. P2H2P fulfillments require different packaging and an Air
    Waybill (AWB) number. This information is required for merchants to decide on
    the packaging required for shipment. /on_search

    entity responsible for collecting payment from the end buyer, along with settlement
    details. If "collected_by" is BPP, the logistics service provider will handle
    payment collection, as seen in Cash on Delivery (COD) transactions. Within the
    settlement_details, information regarding the party with whom the payment needs
    to be settled will be provided. If the payment mode is "ON_ORDER", the Buyer App
    (BAP) will collect payment from the buyer. In this scenario, the Logistics Service
    Provider (LSP) will provide their details in on_Init call for the settlement of
    the delivery charges.

    in the /select call, the retail seller — now acting as the LBNP — can initiate
    the /search call to the LSP. Q. When can we initiate a search call for logistics?
    The /search call must be initiated by the LBNP (buyer) and sent to the gateway
    URL. The gateway will then broadcast this request to all sellers who can service
    the item or are available in the specified area. Below are the Gateway URL for
    each environment:- Staging:- https://staging.gateway.proteantech.in/search Pre-Production:-
    https://preprod.gateway.ondc.org/search Production:- Q. What does @ondc/org/payload_details
    tags defines @ondc/org/payload_details specifies the length, breadth, height,
    and overall dimensions of the packages to be delivered. It also includes the actual
    item price and its category, indicating whether the item is classified as a dangerous
    good or not. Q. What is forward and backward shippment? A forward shipment refers
    to the process where the logistics buyer (LBNP) provides both the pickup (start)
    and drop-off (end) locations to facilitate the delivery of an order to the end
    customer. This is the standard flow for delivering a product once an order is
    placed. On the other hand, a reverse shipment (also known as a backward shipment
    or return to origin - RTO) occurs when the end customer refuses to accept the
    order, cancels it after dispatch, or initiates a return for any reason (e.g.,
    damaged item, incorrect product, or no longer needed). In such cases, the logistics
    provider is responsible for picking up the product from the customer's location
    and returning it to the original seller's location or warehouse.

- question: What is RTO initiated and RTO Disposed?
  answer: RTO (Return to Origin) is a key part of the order fulfillment lifecycle
    and involves multiple stages. Two critical states in this process are "RTO-Initiated"
    and "RTO-Delivered" or "RTO-Disposed". RTO-Initiated This state marks the beginning
    of the return-to-origin process. It is triggered when the forward delivery attempt
    fails due to reasons such as recipient refusal, an undeliverable address, or other
    valid causes. At this point, the item is prepared for return to its original pickup
    location. The timestamp recorded in this state represents the official start of
    the RTO process. The location typically reflects the last delivery attempt location,
    where the delivery failed. RTO-Delivered / RTO-Disposed These states indicate
    the closure of the RTO cycle. RTO-Delivered signifies that the item has been successfully
    returned to the original pickup location. The timestamp for this state marks the
    completion of the return journey. The associated location is usually the seller's
    warehouse or the origin point of the shipment. RTO-Disposed indicates that the
    item has been discarded instead of being returned. This usually applies to goods
    that are perishable, damaged, or otherwise not fit for return. The timestamp here
    marks the completion of the disposal process, and the location corresponds to
    where the item was disposed of. Q. On which call RTO can be initiated? RTO can
    be initiated in an unsolicited / solicited /on_cancel event. In such cases, a
    return (RTO) fulfillment entry will be added immediately after the original delivery
    fulfillment within the fulfillments array. This RTO fulfillment will include a
    timestamp indicating when the return process was initiated.

- question: Is it possible to have only cascaded logistics flow with retail?
  answer: Both cascaded and uncascaded logistics flows are possible. In a typical
    cascaded flow, a retail buyer selects items in the cart, and the Logistics Buyer
    (LBNP) searches for a logistics service provider (LSP) to fulfill the order. It
    receives multiple catalogs and initiates the logistics order with one of the LSPs.
    After the buyer confirms the order, LBNP confirms the logistics order. However,
    there is a possibility that the chosen LSP may delay pickup or cancel the order
    after confirmation. In such cases, LBNP can cancel the logistics order, cascading
    it back so that the seller can cancel the retail order. Alternatively, LBNP can
    search for another LSP and confirm the order with them. Non cascaded flow is independent
    logistics flow. Where an independent logistics buyer wants to buy logistics, and
    it should be implemented as per contract api calls.
