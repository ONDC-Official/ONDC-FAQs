- question: Is ONDC live in production?
  answer: 'ONDC is live in its production environment.  The ONDC integration process involves three environments: Staging, Pre-Production, and Production.  After a Network Participant (NP) completes the integration and testing process in the Staging and Pre-Production environments, they move to the Production environment.  This Production environment is where real-time transactions occur on the ONDC network.  Successfully completing functional testing, complying with the final checklist, and navigating a probationary period in the Production environment qualifies an NP to "Go-Live" on Production, meaning they can begin real e-commerce operations on ONDC.  The ONDC website and documentation refer to NPs and their applications as "live" on the network, indicating the Production environment is active and facilitating real transactions.'
