- question: What is ONDC?
  answer: ONDC (Open Network for Digital Commerce) is an Indian government-backed
    initiative aimed at democratizing digital commerce by enabling open, inclusive,
    and interoperable e-commerce eco-system. It allows buyers and sellers to connect
    across different platforms. Like UPI transformed digital payments, ONDC seeks
    to empower small businesses, local retailers, and consumers by providing equal
    access to digital markets. The network supports multiple apps for buying, selling,
    and logistics, ensuring transparency, lower costs, and wider choices.

- question: How is ONDC different from traditional e-commerce platforms?
  answer: Unlike traditional platforms that are centralized and closed, ONDC is a
    decentralized open network. Any buyer app can interact with any seller app, enabling
    fair competition and wider reach.

- question: How Does ONDC Work?
  answer: 'Protocol-Based: ONDC uses open-source Beckn Protocol to standardize transactions.

    Interoperability: A seller listed on one app (e.g., Meesho) becomes visible on
    all ONDC buyer apps (e.g., Paytm).

    No Middleman: Sellers set prices, manage inventory, and choose logistics independently.
    ONDC works as an open network that connects buyers, sellers, and service providers
    (like logistics) through a common digital protocol, instead of relying on a single
    e-commerce platform. Participants (apps or businesses) join the network in roles
    such as: Buyer Apps – Used by customers to search and shop (e.g., Paytm, PhonePe)
    Seller Apps – Used by merchants to list products and manage orders Logistics Providers
    – Handle delivery across the network When a customer places an order on a buyer
    app, ONDC matches it with a seller and delivery provider from different platforms
    — all seamlessly integrated. This creates a decentralized and interoperable e-commerce
    system, much like how UPI enables payments between different banks and apps.'

  - Getting Started with ONDC
- question: Is ONDC a government app?
  answer: No, ONDC is not an app but a government-backed open protocol (like UPI for
    e-commerce). Private companies build apps (e.g., Paytm, Magicpin) that use ONDC’s
    network.
  tags:
  - Getting Started with ONDC
- question: Is ONDC Free to Use?
  answer: 'ONDC itself does not charge buyers or sellers for using the network. However,
    individual Network Participants (like Seller Apps, Buyer Apps, or Gateways) may
    apply their own fees for onboarding, transactions, or services. These fees are
    typically lower than those on traditional e-commerce platforms. Buyers:  Buyer
    Apps may apply convenience fees (if any). The actual costs depend on the participants
    you engage with, not ONDC directly.'

- question: What is the Gateway in ONDC?
  answer: The Gateway is a crucial component in the ONDC network that facilitates
    discovery by routing search requests from Buyer Apps (BAPs) to all registered
    Seller Apps (BPPs). It does not send responses back to the BAP—its role is limited
    to multicasting the search request across the network. The BPPs then respond directly
    to the BAP with on_search. Gateway Endpoints:-

- question: What is the registry in ONDC?
  answer: 'The ONDC Registry is a central directory of all Network Participants (NPs)
    in a given environment (Staging, Preprod, or Prod). It stores: NP’s base API URLs
    Supported domains (e.g., Grocery, Mobility) Each environment has its own registry;
    participants must subscribe to the appropriate registry before transacting in
    that environment.'
  tags:
  - Public keys for digital signature validation
- question: Do all messages pass through the Gateway?
  answer: No. Only discovery-phase messages (like /search) go through the Gateway.
    After sellers respond to discovery, all other protocol messages—such as /select,
    /init, /confirm, etc.—are exchanged directly between Buyer App and Seller App
    over secure channels (peer-to-peer).
  tags:
  - Public keys for digital signature validation
- question: How does the Gateway decide which Seller Apps receive a search request?
  answer: 'The Gateway filters Seller Apps based on: Domain (e.g., Fashion, Grocery,
    F&B) Buyer’s location (city) This ensures only relevant sellers get the request,
    reducing noise and improving efficiency.'
  tags:
  - Public keys for digital signature validation
- question: Can a participant in the Staging environment transact with one in Production?
  answer: No. Each environment is logically and technically isolated. Participants
    registered in one environment cannot communicate with participants in another.

- question: Is ONDC live in production?
  answer: 'ONDC is live in its production environment.  The ONDC integration process
    involves three environments: Staging, Pre-Production, and Production.  After a
    Network Participant (NP) completes the integration and testing process in the
    Staging and Pre-Production environments, they move to the Production environment.  This
    Production environment is where real-time transactions occur on the ONDC network.  Successfully
    completing functional testing, complying with the final checklist, and navigating
    a probationary period in the Production environment qualifies an NP to "Go-Live"
    on Production, meaning they can begin real e-commerce operations on ONDC.  The
    ONDC website and documentation refer to NPs and their applications as "live" on
    the network, indicating the Production environment is active and facilitating
    real transactions.'

- question: "What are logs in the context of ONDC, and how are they used? \n "
  answer: 'Logs are detailed records of requests and responses for all enabled APIs, captured
    during specific scenarios or workflows. They provide a comprehensive history of
    interactions between Network Participants within the ONDC network and are essential
    for debugging, validation, and certification.  For example:- TRV11,the logs can
    be validated using a POST request to the Log Validation Utility at https://log-validation.ondc.org/api/validate/trv/trv11. The structure for the validation payload is: { "domain": "ONDC: TRV11",
    "version": "2.0.0", "flow": "STATION_CODE", // or GPS or CANCEL "payload": { "search_1":
    {}, "on_search_1": {}, "search_2": {}, "on_search_2": {}, "select": {}, "on_select":
    {}, "init": {}, "on_init": {}, "confirm": {}, "on_confirm": {}, "status": {},
    "on_status": {} } } Each key in the payload corresponds to a specific API call
    and its response. For instance: "search_1" contains the initial Search request
    payload, "on_search_1" contains the corresponding on_search response from the
    seller app. The exact sequence and structure of API calls depend on the selected
    flow — such as "STATION_CODE", "GPS", or "CANCEL". For retail logs (version 1.2.0),
    a similar validation utility exists at https://log-validation.ondc.org/api/validate,
    with a different payload structure and available flows.  The logs for retail,
    IGM (Issue & Grievance Management), and RSF (Reconciliation and Settlement Framework)
    need to be submitted to a designated GitHub repository after self-testing.'

- question: 'What is to be used as a subscriber_id: http domain or some text id in
    a particular format?'
  answer: 'In Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC), the subscriber_id is a unique
    identifier associated with a network participant (such as a seller app, buyer
    app, logistics provider) during the onboarding process. It is typically the domain
    name or endpoint that uniquely identifies that participant within the ONDC network.
    The subscriber_id’s default value will be the Fully Qualified Domain Name of the
    subscriber unless specified otherwise as a network policy. (usually a domain format
    like ondc.seller.example) It is used in API requests to identify who is making
    the call, and appears in the context object of ONDC payloads. It is linked with
    authentication — used along with keys like unique_key_id (UKID) to sign and verify
    API requests. It is part of the ONDC Registry''s Subscriber object which stores
    details of the participant. Buyer Apps (bap_id) and Seller Apps (bpp_id) in payloads
    are both subscriber_ids. { "context": { "domain": "nic2004:52110", "bap_id": "buyerapp.example.com",  //

- question: What is the difference between subscriber id and subscriber url?
  answer: 'The ONDC network utilises two identifiers for subscribers: a subscriber
    ID and a subscriber URL. While both serve the purpose of identifying participants
    within the network, they differ in their nature and function. Subscriber_id: A
    unique, identifier assigned to each subscriber within the ONDC network Subscriber_url:
    A publicly accessible URL that points to the subscriber''s information and endpoints
    hosted within the ONDC network. It is an extension to the subscriber id domain.
    Make sure subscriber_url includes subscriber id.


    Example: Suppose a network participant has the domain ondc.seller.example, their
    subscriber ID becomes "ondc.seller.example" and their subscriber URL can be  or
    any subroute with the domain ondc.seller.example where they are hosting their
    API endpoints for ONDC transactions.'

    100%. Once this is done, you can proceed to request domain whitelisting on portal
    : Home > Environment Access Request. For Preprod: Self Declaration is required
    to be submitted through the portal and then the whitelisting request needs to
    be raised through the portal itself. For Prod: After your preprod logs are verified
    and the QA process is completed, you''re ready to go to the production environment.
    You may then raise a whitelisting request like all the other environments and
    proceed.'

- question: What is ONDC site verification and what is its purpose?
  answer: 'ONDC site verification is a mandatory step in the subscriber onboarding
    process. It is used by the ONDC Registry to perform domain verification for the
    declared subscriber_id. The process involves the following steps: Generate a Unique
    Request ID (request_id): This can be any unique identifier such as a UUID, number,
    or alphanumeric string. Sign the Request ID: Use your signing_private_key to sign
    the request_id using the Ed25519 algorithm (without hashing). This will generate
    a SIGNED_UNIQUE_REQ_ID. You can use the on_subscribe utility to assist with this
    step. Create the ondc-site-verification.html file: Host this file at the root
    of your subscriber_id domain (e.g., https://<subscriber_id>/ondc-site-verification.html)
    and include the SIGNED_UNIQUE_REQ_ID inside it. The ONDC Registry will check for
    this file to validate that the domain is correctly set up before allowing subscription.'

    and x25519 and would keep the private key with them Registry would use its private
    and public encryption key to derive the aes key for encrypting the challenge.
    Participants will use their own Private key and registry's public key to derive
    the AES key that was used for encryption. And decrypt the challenge using this
    key.

- question: If subscriber A needs to get the public key of Subscriber B when doing
    a transaction, then does it need to call lookup API to check whether Subscriber
    B exists?
  answer: 'Yes, Subscriber A needs to call the lookup API to get the public key of
    Subscriber B and verify if Subscriber B exists in the registry. The lookup API
    only returns subscriber records that have status = "SUBSCRIBED" or “WHITELISTED”.
    Here''s a detailed explanation: 1. Why Lookup? ONDC relies on public-key cryptography
    for secure communication. When Subscriber A wants to interact with Subscriber
    B, it needs Subscriber B''s public key to verify signatures and ensure the message
    is from a trusted source. 2. Lookup API: The ONDC registry provides a lookup API
    that allows subscribers to fetch the public key of other subscribers using their
    `subscriber_id`. 3. Active Status Check: The lookup API''s response includes a
    "status" field indicating the subscriber''s status.  Subscriber A should check
    if Subscriber B''s status is "SUBSCRIBED". This ensures that Subscriber B is active
    on the network and the communication will be successful. 4. Postman curl Example:
    curl --location ''https://prod.registry.ondc.org/v2.0/lookup'' \ --header ''Content-Type:
    application/json'' \ --header ''Authorization: Signature keyId="example-bap.com|bap1234|ed25519",
    algorithm="ed25519", created="<timestamp>", expires="<timestamp>", headers="(created)(expires)digest",
    signature="<signature>"'' \ --data ''{ "country": "IND", "domain": "ONDC:RET10"
    }'''

- question: Does the lookup API need to be called before calling any APIs?
  answer: 'The Lookup API is not mandatory to call before every API request. Instead,
    it serves as a utility that subscribers can use whenever they need to resolve
    information about another participant—typically to fetch their public keys, network
    roles, or endpoint details from the ONDC Registry. This is particularly important
    for verifying the signatures in data payloads exchanged over the network. For
    example, you may use the Lookup API to fetch a seller app’s signing public key
    when validating a signed message. Recommendation for efficiency: To reduce frequent
    calls to the Lookup API, participants can cache the public registry dump periodically.
    This dump includes information about all network participants and their public
    signing keys. You can then rely on your local cache for most lookups, and use
    the v2.0/lookup API only as a fallback mechanism when the cache is outdated or
    a new participant needs to be resolved.'

- question: Why is the subscriber_url showing as null in the registry after subscribing?
  answer: 'The subscriber_url appears as null when the participant is only whitelisted.
    It gets updated in the registry once you complete the onboarding by calling the
    subscribe API with your subscriber_url. The value provided in that API call will
    be saved and reflected in the registry records. Key-wise explanation to subscribe

    unique_key_id The `request_id` and `unique_key_id` are distinct random alphanumeric
    strings or UUIDs generated by the network participant. callback_url The callback_url
    in ONDC is a relative path provided during the subscription process. It tells
    ONDC where to send verification callbacks like on_subscribe. The final callback
    endpoint URL is constructed as: https://<subscriber_url>/<callback_url>/on_subscribe
    If: subscriber_id = callback_url = /api/ondc Then the final on_subscribe callback
    URL will be: https://www.sellerapp.example.com/api/ondc/on_subscribe key_pairs

    in the subscribe payload, which were generated during the key generation process.
    Additionally, they need to specify the keys'' validity period using the `valid_from`
    and `valid_until` fields. network_participant The network participant includes
    a `domains` object specifying the domains they wish to subscribe to. For instance,
    if the network participant is whitelisted for `ONDC:RET10` and `ONDC:RET11`, they
    need to include two objects in the `network_participant` array as shown below:
    ```json "network_participant": [ { "subscriber_url": "/ret10", "domain": "ONDC:RET10",
    "type": "sellerApp", "msn": false, "city_code": ["*"] }, { "subscriber_url": "/ret11",
    "domain": "ONDC:RET11", "type": "sellerApp", "msn": false, "city_code": ["*"]
    } ] `` subscriber_url Essentially, this field represents the relative path to
    where your transactional API endpoints are hosted. For example, if your endpoint
    is subscriber_id/api/v1/search, then the subscriber_url in the subscriber payload
    should be set to /api/v1. In the JSON, the subscriber_url is defined for each
    domain, allowing different relative paths based on domain-specific requirements.
    For instance, ONDC:RET10 might have a subscriber_url like /ret10, whereas ONDC:RET11
    could use /ret11. Alternatively, you can adopt an API versioning approach — such
    as /api/v1 — as the subscriber_url. If you''re hosting your APIs at the root level,
    then / would be the value used in the payload.'

- question: I am facing a Signature verification issue with the Reference apps or
    Mock servers. How do I resolve this?
  answer: 'Points to consider while generating signatures: One of the plausible reasons
    can be that you aren’t sending the same payload as you have used for the generating
    signature. For example, you have generated the signature with minify json. But
    when you are making a http request you have or your editor has beautified the
    payload. Secondly, make sure there are no escape characters added in the signature
    instead of space. After generating the signature, changing the context_timestamp
    to current time while making http request will receive NACK for Signature verification.
    It is not accepted if you make any change after generating the signature. Furthermore,
    You have added a wrong subscriber_id or unique_key while generating the signature.
    Make sure you put the signature in the Header as an Authorization key not in Bearer
    Token. While generating a signature through an endpoint as shown in the image
    below. It returns as json (stringified version)  which means addition of escape
    characters. It is crucial to ensure the signature remains intact and free from

    \ Implementation Guide: Process Walkthroughs The ONDC onboarding process begins\
    \ with key generation, where participants create a signing key pair using the\
    \ Ed25519 algorithm and an encryption key pair using the X25519 algorithm (in\
    \ ASN.1 DER format). Utilities for this are available in multiple languages such\
    \ as Java, Python, Node.js, PHP, and Go. Once the keys are generated, participants\
    \ move to endpoint setup, which includes generating a unique request_id, signing\
    \ it, and hosting the ondc-site-verification.html file at the appropriate URL\
    \ for domain verification. Additionally, the /on_subscribe endpoint must be implemented\
    \ and hosted to handle challenge decryption using a shared key derived from the\
    \ encryption keys. After these technical prerequisites are met, participants prepare\
    \ a /subscribe request that includes essential entity details such as subscriber\
    \ ID, callback URLs, public keys, and a unique key ID. The appropriate operation\
    \ type (e.g., Buyer App, Seller App, or both) is selected based on the participant’s\
    \ role. The final subscription request is then submitted to the ONDC Registry\
    \ endpoint corresponding to the relevant environment (Staging, Pre-Prod, or Production)\
    \ to complete the onboarding process. Once you receive an ACK response from the\
    \ Registry, your entity is successfully subscribed to the ONDC network. Once a\
    \ Network Participant (NP) successfully subscribes to the ONDC Registry, it can\
    \ perform a self-lookup to validate its presence in the network. This is done\
    \ by calling the /lookup API using its own subscriber_id. This journey is crucial\
    \ for NPs to verify whether their registration details (including subscriber type,\
    \ domain, city, signing/public keys, and endpoint URLs) are correctly recorded\
    \ in the registry. This also serves as a quick way to test connectivity with the\
    \ registry and confirm successful onboarding. The same lookup flow is used by\
    \ other participants (like gateways and seller apps) to retrieve public keys and\
    \ endpoint information for interaction and signature verification. To maintain\
    \ trust and ensure message integrity in the ONDC network, every request initiated\
    \ by an NP must include an Authorization header. This header is a cryptographic\
    \ signature created using the NP’s private signing key. The NP starts by generating\
    \ a digest of the request body using the BLAKE-512 hash function. Then, it appends\
    \ timestamp fields (created and expires) and constructs a signing string. This\
    \ string is signed with Ed25519 using the NP’s private key, and the resulting\
    \ signature is encoded in base64 and attached to the Authorization header. This\
    \ header is validated by the receiving NP (or Gateway), which retrieves the sender’s\
    \ public key using the /lookup API and verifies the signature before accepting\
    \ the request. This guarantees that the payload is authentic and untampered. In\
    \ a standard ONDC transactional flow such as /search, the Buyer App (BAP) initiates\
    \ a request to the Gateway. The Gateway first validates the Authorization header\
    \ by fetching the BAP’s public key using the /lookup API and performing signature\
    \ verification. It then validates the schema (specifically the context block)\
    \ and, if successful, signs the payload with its own private key, adding the X-Gateway-Authorization\
    \ header. The Gateway reads the domain and city from the context and broadcasts\
    \ the request to all eligible Seller Apps (BPPs) discovered via registry lookup.\
    \ After that, the flow becomes entirely peer-to-peer. Each Seller App validates\
    \ both headers, fetches public keys from the registry, and if the checks pass,\
    \ it processes the /search request. It then responds with a /on_search callback\
    \ sent directly to the Buyer App by appending /on_search to the subscriber_url\
    \ obtained via registry lookup. No further gateway involvement is needed after\
    \ the initial broadcast, making all subsequent communication directly between\
    \ network participants. Transactional Flow for IGM (Issue and Grievance Management)\
    \ Issue and Grievance Management (IGM) is a key component within the ONDC (Open\
    \ Network for Digital Commerce) ecosystem. It provides a structured and standardized\
    \ way for participants to raise, manage, and resolve disputes or issues that may\
    \ arise during or after an order is fulfilled. This could include problems such\
    \ as wrong items delivered, damaged products, delays, or payment discrepancies.\
    \ There are two versions of IGM that define how issues are handled: IGM 1.0.0\
    \ In IGM 1.0.0, the buyer is the only party allowed to raise an issue. The issue\
    \ is addressed by the seller (or the seller app), who is responsible for providing\
    \ a resolution. Issues can be raised at two levels: Item-level: Specific to a\
    \ particular item in the order (e.g., one item was damaged or missing). Fulfillment-level:\
    \ Related to the delivery or the overall order experience (e.g., delayed shipment,\
    \ incomplete order). The resolution process involves the seller responding with\
    \ possible actions like replacement, refund, or clarification. IGM 2.0.0 In IGM\
    \ 2.0.0, the process is bi-directional – meaning both the buyer and the seller\
    \ can raise issues. This version introduces greater flexibility and a more balanced\
    \ dispute resolution framework. Both parties (buyer and seller) have the ability\
    \ to: Raise an issue against each other. Respond to and resolve the issue. This\
    \ version supports a wider range of scenarios, including: Sellers raising issues\
    \ for fraudulent buyer claims. Buyers continue to raise issues related to order\
    \ problems. Issue resolution can still be based on the item or fulfillment level,\
    \ but now both parties can initiate and participate in the process actively. The\
    \ Journey of Financial Information Service (FIS) API The Financial Information\
    \ Service (FIS) API transforms the process of securing a personal loan into a\
    \ structured, transparent, and efficient journey. Through the open network, borrowers\
    \ and lenders connect seamlessly, guided by a series of well-defined steps facilitated\
    \ by the Borrower Platform (BAP) and Lender Platforms (BPPs). This narrative outlines\
    \ the journey, from the initial search for a loan to its final confirmation and\
    \ ongoing status updates, emphasizing clarity, trust, and technological precision.\
    \ Initiating the Search for Financial Opportunities: The journey begins when a\
    \ borrower, seeking a personal loan, engages the Borrower Platform (BAP). The\
    \ BAP initiates a search request, sending a query through the network’s gateway\
    \ to the registry. The registry identifies available Lender Platforms (BPPs) capable\
    \ of offering personal loan services. The gateway forwards the search request\
    \ to these BPPs, which respond with an on_search callback, publishing their loan\
    \ catalogs. These catalogs contain a variety of loan products, complete with details\
    \ such as loan types, interest rates, repayment terms, and eligibility criteria,\
    \ accessible via the Swagger Link. This transparent exchange opens a world of\
    \ possibilities, allowing the borrower to explore tailored financial solutions.\
    \ Exploring a Catalog of Loan Offers: Upon receiving the on_search response, the\
    \ BAP presents the borrower with a comprehensive catalog of loan offers from multiple\
    \ BPPs. Each offer is detailed, showcasing key information like interest rates,\
    \ loan tenures, and specific terms. This stage empowers the borrower to compare\
    \ options side by side, evaluating which loan aligns best with their financial\
    \ goals. The open network ensures that all relevant details are accessible, fostering\
    \ informed decision-making and eliminating the opacity often associated with traditional\
    \ loan searches. Selecting the Ideal Loan Product: With a clear view of available\
    \ options, the borrower selects a specific loan offer that meets their needs.\
    \ The BAP sends a select request to the chosen BPP, indicating the preferred loan\
    \ product. This action marks a pivotal moment in the journey, as the borrower\
    \ commits to pursuing a specific financial path, confident in their choice based\
    \ on the transparent information provided. Receiving Detailed Loan Information:\
    \ The lender responds with an on_select callback, acknowledging the borrower’s\
    \ selection and providing detailed information about the chosen loan product.\
    \ This response may include a dynamic form, prompting the borrower to specify\
    \ details such as the desired loan amount or repayment term. The BAP displays\
    \ this form to the borrower, ensuring a user-friendly experience as they input\
    \ the requested information, which is then relayed back to the BPP. This step\
    \ ensures the loan is tailored to the borrower’s unique requirements. Specifying\
    \ Loan Details: If a dynamic form is provided, the borrower completes it, entering\
    \ critical details such as the loan amount and preferred term. The BAP facilitates\
    \ this process, securely collecting and transmitting the information to the BPP.\
    \ This form (Loan Details) submission refines the loan offer, aligning it closely\
    \ with the borrower’s financial objectives and setting the stage for a formal\
    \ application. Formalizing the Loan Application: With the loan details submitted,\
    \ the BAP sends an init request to the BPP, formally initiating the loan application\
    \ process. This request includes the selected loan product, requested amount,\
    \ term, and any additional details gathered through the form. This step transitions\
    \ the journey from exploration to a structured engagement, signaling the borrower’s\
    \ intent to move forward with the chosen lender. Refining the Application with\
    \ Additional Information: The BPP responds with an on_init callback, acknowledging\
    \ the initialization and potentially providing additional dynamic forms to collect\
    \ further details. These forms may request Know Your Customer (KYC) information,\
    \ bank account details for loan disbursement, or e-mandate setup for repayments.\
    \ The BAP presents these form (KYC, Bank Details, e-Mandate) requirements to the\
    \ borrower, who completes and submits them. The lender also provides an initial\
    \ loan status update and may include additional terms, ensuring both parties are\
    \ aligned as the application progresses. Submitting Comprehensive Details: After\
    \ completing the additional forms, the BAP sends another init request, incorporating\
    \ the submission_id from the form submissions. This ensures all required information—KYC\
    \ documents, bank details, or e-mandate authorizations—is securely transmitted\
    \ to the BPP. The open network’s robust infrastructure guarantees that sensitive\
    \ data is handled with care, maintaining security and compliance throughout the\
    \ process. Processing and Updating the Application: The BPP processes the submitted\
    \ information and responds with an on_init callback, updating the loan application\
    \ status. This response confirms that the additional details have been received\
    \ and integrated, moving the application closer to completion. The borrower remains\
    \ informed through the BAP, which provides real-time updates on the application’s\
    \ progress, ensuring transparency and engagement. Reviewing the Loan Agreement:\
    \ As the application nears finalization, the BPP sends a form (Loan Agreement)\
    \ to the BAP, presenting the formal loan agreement for the borrower’s review.\
    \ This document outlines all terms, including interest rates, repayment schedules,\
    \ and responsibilities. The BAP displays the agreement, allowing the borrower\
    \ to review it carefully and provide an e-signature to indicate acceptance. This\
    \ step is critical, as it formalizes the borrower’s commitment to the loan terms.\
    \ Confirming the Loan Application: Once the borrower signs the loan agreement,\
    \ the BAP sends a confirm request to the BPP, finalizing the loan application.\
    \ This action solidifies the partnership between the borrower and the lender,\
    \ marking the successful completion of the application process. The open network\
    \ ensures that this confirmation is securely communicated, maintaining a clear\
    \ record of the agreement. Receiving Final Confirmation: The BPP responds with\
    \ an on_confirm callback, providing final confirmation details to the borrower.\
    \ This response confirms that the loan order is complete, and the loan is ready\
    \ for sanctioning or disbursement. The borrower receives clear communication through\
    \ the BAP, ensuring they understand the next steps, whether it’s awaiting funds\
    \ or activating repayment schedules. Monitoring Loan Status: Even after confirmation,\
    \ the journey continues with ongoing support. The BAP can send periodic status\
    \ requests to the BPP to check the loan’s progress—whether it has been sanctioned,\
    \ disbursed, or is in repayment. The BPP responds with updates, which the BAP\
    \ relays to the borrower, ensuring they remain informed at every stage. The open\
    \ network’s commitment to transparency ensures that the borrower is never left\
    \ in the dark, fostering trust and clarity throughout the loan lifecycle. Conclusion:\
    \ The journey through personal loan acquisition via the FIS API is a testament\
    \ to the power of open networks in revolutionizing financial services. By connecting\
    \ borrowers with lenders through a structured, transparent, and secure process,\
    \ the FIS API empowers individuals to make informed decisions, access tailored\

    \ to communicate seamlessly with those using 1.2.5.\n\nException – RTO Flow: The\
    \ updated RTO (Return to Origin) flow is not backward compatible with version\
    \ 1.2.0. Because of this, 1.2.5 and 1.2.0 are considered side-by-side compatible\
    \ rather than fully backward compatible.\n\nInteraction Scenarios:- An LBNP using\
    \ 1.2.0 may receive responses in either 1.2.0 or 1.2.5 from LSPs. An LBNP using\
    \ 1.2.5 may also receive responses in either 1.2.0 or 1.2.5.When responding with\
    \ version 1.2.5, the LSP must include the list of features it supports. An LBNP\
    \ using 1.2.5 can activate business workflows dynamically based on discovered\
    \ feature support from the LSP. Additional Notes:-Systems may implement a version\
    \ check for compatibility with \"1.2.*\" to support both 1.2.0 and 1.2.5 flexibly.\
    \ Transactional Flow for RSF (Reconciliation and Settlement Framework) Reconciliation\
    \ and Settlement Framework:- The Reconciliation and Settlement Framework (RSF)\
    \ governs how money flows between buyers, sellers, and other network participants\
    \ (NPs) on the ONDC network.  RSF 2.0 introduces a claim-based payout system where\
    \ both Buyer Apps (acting as Collectors) and Seller Apps (acting as Receivers)\
    \ submit their settlement details independently to the Settlement Agency (SA).\
    \ Here's a breakdown of the transaction flow: Standard Flow (Buyer App as Collector,\
    \ Seller App as Receiver, distinct legal entities): Order Placement and Payment:\
    \ A buyer places an order through a Buyer App and makes a payment.  The Buyer\
    \ App becomes the Collector of funds. /settle Call (Both Buyer and Seller Apps):\
    \ The Seller App (Receiver) sends a /settle call to the SA, claiming the amount\
    \ due to them (including their commission and any amount owed to the Seller on\
    \ Record). The Buyer App (Collector) also sends a /settle call to the SA, specifying\
    \ the order details and the amount to be settled. Order Matching and Reconciliation:\
    \ The SA matches the orders submitted by both the Buyer App and Seller App based\
    \ on order details. Balance Check: The SA checks if the Buyer App's account for\
    \ ONDC settlement has sufficient funds. Fund Transfer: If the balance is sufficient,\
    \ the SA instructs the banks to transfer funds: From the Buyer App's (Collector's)\
    \ account for ONDC settlement to the Seller App's (Receiver's) account for ONDC\
    \ settlement. From the Seller App's account for ONDC settlement to the Seller\
    \ on Record's bank account (if last-mile settlement is opted in by the Seller\
    \ App). From the Buyer App's (Collector's) account for ONDC settlement to the\
    \ Buyer App's (Collector's) operating account for the Buyer Finder Fee (BFF).\
    \ From the Seller App's (Receiver's) account for ONDC settlement to the Seller\
    \ App's (Receiver's) operating account for their commission. /on_settle (Settlement\
    \ Confirmation): The SA notifies both the Buyer App and Seller App about the successful\
    \ settlement, providing settlement reference numbers with status “SETTLED” or\
    \ “NOT-SETTLED”. Onboarding process with SA\nThe onboarding process with a Settlement\
    \ Account (SA) involves several steps for Network Participants (NPs) on the ONDC\
    \ network.NPs can reach out to the Settlement Agency (SA) via the contact email\
    \   provided on the ONDC website  . NPs are required to open an account for ONDC\
    \ settlement with banks onboarded on NPCI-NBBL NOCS. NPs are expected to follow\
    \ the following steps as per their respective role on the ONDC network. As a Buyer\
    \ App or Marketplace Seller App (MSN): On ONDC’s & SA’s  website, refer to the\
    \ published list of banks onboarded with SA Open an account for ONDC settlement\
    \ either with your existing bank, if it's on the published list, or with another\
    \ bank from the list Confirm that you have an account for ONDC settlement with\
    \ an SA on-boarded bank on ONDC’s NP portal Declare  on ONDC’s NP portal that\
    \ you have completed integration with SA Post go-live on the network, start making\
    \ claims to SA for receivables As an Inventory Seller App (ISN): Choose either\
    \ of the following options: Option 1: Follow steps 1 to 7 as mentioned above;\
    \ similar to Buyer App or Marketplace Seller App (MSN) Option 2: Alternatively,\
    \ follow the following steps- (A) If you will never be the Collector (take money\
    \ from the buyer directly) or will never take on-network logistics\n- don’t open\
    \ a new account for ONDC settlement with an SA on-boarded bank; and continue with\
    \ your existing bank account\n\n(B) If you will be the Collector (take money from\
    \ the buyer directly) or will take on-network logistics sometime in the future\n\
    - open a new account for ONDC settlement with an SA on-boarded bank; and continue\
    \ with your existing bank account Declare on ONDC’s NP portal that you have completed\
    \ API integration with SA Post go-live on the network, initiate receivables claims\

  - Retail API related queries
- question: What are action and on_action calls?
  answer: action calls are made by Buyer apps to seller apps. on_action calls are
    made by Seller app to buyer apps for action calls they received. There are few
    unsolicited on_action calls made by Seller app when there is change in order status
    like on_status,on_update. Search,select,init are few action calls. On_search,on_select,on_init
    are few on_action calls.

  - Retail API related queries
- question: What is an incremental catalog refresh?
  answer: An incremental catalog refresh is a lightweight update mechanism that allows
    buyer Network Participants (NPs) to refresh their cached catalogs by receiving
    only the changes since the last full catalog update. This includes modifications
    such as item updates, store closures, or store deactivations, making the process
    more efficient than sending the entire catalog each time.

- question: What does ‘TTL’ mean in ONDC?
  answer: TTL (Time To Live) defines how long a message remains valid within the network.
    It ensures that requests are timely and relevant by setting an expiration duration.
    TTL is typically expressed in ISO8601 duration format — for example, PT30S represents
    30 seconds.

- question: How is  Retail API contract  version 1.1.0 different from  Retail API
    contract version 1.2.0?
  answer: The current API contract is at version 1.2, while the previous version,
    1.1, has been deprecated. Version 1.1 established the basic framework for essential
    retail operations, enabling the smooth execution of the happy flow along with
    other common processes like order cancellations. To improve the overall functionality
    and coverage of the contract, version 1.2.0 was introduced. This new version not
    only aims to enhance the robustness of the API but also to better align it with
    the sophisticated functionalities found in platform ecosystems, thereby providing
    buyers with a more consistent and seamless user experience. Key improvements in
    version 1.2.0 include advanced catalog caching mechanisms, as well as support
    for additional scenarios such as product customizations, handling of variants,
    streamlined return processes, and order tracking capabilities.

- question: What is the major difference between the transaction_id and message_id
    ?
  answer: 'transaction_id remains the same for the whole transaction flow i.e. for
    the discovery and fulfillment phases, the transaction_id will remain same.

    In contrast, the message_id will be unique for every pair of action and on_action
    calls. Also it’d be unique for unsolicited on_action calls'

  answer: 'Firstly, the NP will have to give the demo for the staging environment.
    Once the  demo is done then they will have to get their subscriber_id whitelisted
    for pre-prod. For that, NP has to submit the request for whitelisting on the NP
    Portal. Once whitelisted, they can call the /subscribe API to get registered on
    Pre-prod.

  answer: 'Request Incremental Catalog Refresh (Pull) is a process where a system
    requests only the updated or changed parts of a catalog since the last update,
    instead of retrieving the entire catalog. The Buyer NP requests a one-time incremental
    refresh: start_time is before Context.timestamp, end_time is also before Context.timestamp,
    and end_time is after start_time (meaning the Buyer NP pulls incremental updates
    between start_time and end_time in a single solicited response).'

- question: As we are aggregating multiple buyers for multiple cities, the search
    gets initiated and every search result via the gateway results in 3 GB of data.
  answer: Search should be initiated for each city and cached on your end. Since the
    catalog includes full details of the seller app/sellers and their serviceability,
    you may ingest, process, and cache it on your side. The buyer can then search
    directly from these cached results. As the number of seller NPs and sellers on
    the network grows, the volume of resultant data will also increase. Therefore,
    effective filtering and catalog rejection processes should be implemented to eliminate
    poor-quality catalogs or payloads.Also, please note that the /on_search response
    is sent directly to the buyer app’s endpoint and not routed through the gateway.
    /on_search
  tags:
  - Product delivered is different from what was shown and ordered
- question: What is on_search? Who sends on_search and to whom?
  answer: The /on_search call is the response from the Seller NP to the Buyer NP's
    /search request.  It contains the requested catalog data (for full refresh) or
    the incremental updates.  The Buyer NP acknowledges the /on_search response with
    an ACK or NACK.  A NACK indicates an issue with ingesting the response, such as
    missing providers, locations, or items.  The on_search response can also include
    deep links to the provider's store on the buyer app and options for the Buyer
    NP to communicate promotions.

  tags:
  - Product delivered is different from what was shown and ordered
- question: When is the init call made?
  answer: '- The /init call is made by the buyer app directly to the seller app after
    the /select call. It signifies the initiation of the order process.  The primary
    purpose of this call is to collect the buyer''s delivery and billing addresses
    and formally initiate the order.  The seller app responds to the /init call with
    the /on_init callback, confirming the order initialization and potentially providing
    additional details.  After the /init and /on_init exchange, both the buyer and
    seller apps possess the necessary product and address information to proceed further
    in the order fulfillment process.  The /init call marks the transition from product
    discovery and selection to the actual order processing stage.  It sets the stage
    for subsequent steps like payment processing and order confirmation.  The direct
    peer-to-peer communication between buyer and seller apps, established during the
    /select call, continues in the /init call, ensuring efficient and real-time information
    exchange. /on_init'
  tags:
  - Product delivered is different from what was shown and ordered
- question: When is on_inti call made?
  answer: 'The on_init call is made by the seller app in response to the init call
    from the buyer app.  The init call signifies the buyer''s intention to initialize
    an order after selecting products through the /search and /select calls.  The
    on_init call serves two primary purposes: Acknowledge Order Initialization and
    Provide Quote: The seller app acknowledges the order initialization request and
    sends back a detailed quote for the order. This quote includes the final price
    breakdown, including item costs, taxes, delivery charges, and any applicable discounts
    or offers.  This allows the buyer to review the final cost before confirming the
    order. Collect Payment (if applicable):  If the seller requires pre-payment, the
    on_init call can also include information necessary for the buyer to proceed with
    payment. This might involve redirecting the buyer to a payment gateway or providing
    payment instructions.  If the payment is handled through a separate process (e.g.,
    Cash on Delivery), this step might be skipped.'

  tags:
  - Product delivered is different from what was shown and ordered
- question: When is the confirmed API call made?
  answer: The /confirm call is made by the Buyer Network Participant (BNP) to the
    Seller Network Participant (SNP) after the buyer has reviewed and accepted the
    final order details provided in the /on_init response.  It signifies the buyer's
    commitment to the purchase.  The SNP should not initiate processing or fulfillment
    of the order until it receives an ACK for the subsequent /on_confirm call.  It's
    crucial that both /confirm and /on_confirm are idempotent to handle potential
    network issues and retries.  The order id, created by the BNP and unique across
    the network, and must be the same in both the /confirm and /on_confirm calls.

  - Product delivered is different from what was shown and ordered
- question: When is the on_confirm call made?
  answer: 'The /on_confirm call is made by the Seller Network Participant (SNP) to
    the Buyer Network Participant (BNP) after receiving the /confirm call from the
    BNP.  It signifies the seller''s confirmation of the order.  Here''s a breakdown
    of the process: /confirm Call (BNP to SNP): The buyer application initiates the
    /confirm call to the seller application. This call contains the final order details,
    including items, quantities, and the agreed-upon quote (which should be the same
    as the quote received in the /on_init call).  The buyer creates a unique order_id
    at this stage. SNP Validations: Upon receiving the /confirm call, the SNP performs
    validations to ensure the order details are accurate and acceptable.  This includes
    checking item availability, pricing, and any other relevant factors.  The SNP
    does not forward the order to the merchant at this point. ACK or NACK to /confirm
    (SNP to BNP): Successful Validation (ACK): If the validation is successful, the
    SNP responds with an ACK (Acknowledgement) to the /confirm call.  This indicates
    to the BNP that the order is accepted.  The SNP creates the order in their system,
    but still does not forward it to the merchant. Validation Failure (NACK): If the
    validation fails, the SNP responds with a NACK (Negative Acknowledgement) along
    with an error code (e.g., 31002 for order validation failure). The BNP should
    then cancel the order with a specific reason code (e.g., 999). Internal Errors
    (NACK): The SNP might also send a NACK due to internal errors (e.g., HTTP 504).  This
    would include a retriable error code (e.g., 31001), prompting the BNP to retry
    the /confirm call. /on_confirm Call (SNP to BNP):  After sending the ACK to the
    /confirm call, the SNP initiates the /on_confirm call to the BNP. This call includes
    the same order_id provided by the BNP in the /confirm call, along with the final
    order details, including the quote, payment details (as in /confirm), and cancellation
    terms.  It may also include additional information like fulfillment slots, agent
    details, or e-way bill numbers (especially for logistics). BNP Validations: The
    BNP, upon receiving the /on_confirm call, performs its own validations to ensure
    the order details match what was sent in the /confirm call. ACK or NACK to /on_confirm
    (BNP to SNP): Successful Validation (ACK): If the BNP''s validation is successful,
    it responds with an ACK to the /on_confirm call.  This triggers the SNP to forward
    the order to the merchant for processing and fulfillment. Validation Failure (NACK):
    If the validation fails, the BNP responds with a NACK and an error code (e.g.,
    23002). The SNP should then cancel the order with a specific reason code (e.g.,
    998) and notify the BNP of the cancellation through an /on_status call. Internal
    Errors (NACK):  Similar to the /confirm call, the BNP might send a NACK due to
    internal errors, prompting the SNP to retry the /on_confirm call. Retries and
    Cancellation: Both the /confirm and /on_confirm calls should be idempotent.  If
    either party doesn''t receive an ACK/NACK within a defined retry interval, they
    should cancel the order with the appropriate reason code.  This ensures that orders
    are not left in an undefined state.'

  - Product delivered is different from what was shown and ordered
- question: What happens if an item goes out of stock when the buyer sends a confirmation
    call for ORDER? Should we NACK it or send an error message in on_confirm?
  answer: Seller should send an error message with out-of-stock just as it is sent
    in on_select. /status
  tags:
  - Product delivered is different from what was shown and ordered
- question: When to call /status API
  answer: The /status call is a request initiated by the Buyer Network Participant
    (Buyer App) to the Seller Network Participant (Seller App) to retrieve the current
    status of an order.  It uses the same transaction_id that was used for the /confirm
    call when the order was placed. This ensures that the status request is linked
    to the correct order. /on_status
  tags:
  - Product delivered is different from what was shown and ordered
- question: Do we need to call status every time for new on_status?
  answer: status call is made to get the real time status of order. Unsolicited on_status
    are sent by the seller whenever there is change in fulfillment of order like order-picked,order
    out-for-delivery,order delivered etc. /update
  tags:
  - Product delivered is different from what was shown and ordered
- question: '- When update settlement is triggered by the buyer app?'
  answer: '- When /on-update with fulfillment Liquidated or Return_Delivered/Return_Dispose
    is triggered by seller app then buyer app triggers update settlement /on_update'
  tags:
  - Product delivered is different from what was shown and ordered
- question: '- What is Liquidated? How it is different from reverse qc.'
  answer: -There are two types of return:- 1. Where the item is returned to the seller.
    2. Seller does not want product back and will refund returns Examples:- The buyer
    wants to return the shirt due to its size. Buyer initiates return. The seller
    wants the product to be shipped back. This is reverse qc The buyer wants to return
    Pizza due to its taste. Buyer initiates return. The seller doesn't want the product
    to be shipped back. Still the seller will refund. This is liquidated.

- question: Who can procure logistics services and how?
  answer: Logistics Service Providers (LSPs) directly engage with sellers, who function
    as logistics buyers. Retail sellers then call action API requests to the logistics
    service providers and receive corresponding on_action responses from them. Additionally,
    the buyer app also has the capability to procure logistics services.

- question: Why is there no select and on-select call in the logistics contract?
  answer: "There's no \"select and on select\" process because once the retail buyer\
    \ builds a cart (in /select call), the seller app starts searching for logistics\
    \ service providers to fulfil the order. LSPs send their catalog of available\
    \ options through /on_search. Logistics buyer which is also the retail seller\
    \ then goes ahead with one of the LSP and cascades back the delivery charges in\
    \ /on_select of the retail contract. Therefore when the buyer app sends the/ init\
    \ request, the logistics buyer also initialises the logistics order with the chosen\
    \ LSP. From then on, all subsequent calls are cascaded. \n\nB. For standalone\
    \ logistic implementation api calls will be as per logistic api contract search\
    \ /search"

- question: What is the "Return" fulfillment type, and when is it used?
  answer: The "Return" fulfillment type is a crucial aspect of the ONDC network's
    order management process, specifically designed to handle return requests from
    buyers. It is used when a buyer wishes to return one or more items from a previously
    delivered order. A "Return" fulfillment is created when a buyer initiates a return
    request for one or more items within the defined return window of the purchased
    items. This return window is specified in the product catalog.

    which refers that within that days payment need to be settle Payment Wallet refers
    to the Payment Wallet process for Logistics Service Providers (LSPs), enabling
    them to establish a prepaid wallet system for logistics buyers. Payments for services
    are deducted directly from this wallet, ensuring a seamless and efficient transaction
    process. A prepaid payment system for logistics can be facilitated through a payment
    wallet managed by the Logistics Service Provider (LSP) on behalf of the Logistics
    Buyer Network Partner (LBNP).

    Payment wallet can be used when you want LBNP to pay at the confirmation of the
    order and not later.'

- question: What is the item descriptor code P2P and P2H2P?
  answer: P2P stands for point-to-point and P2H2P stands for point-to-hub-to-point.
    These codes indicate the type of shipment. P2P is used for hyperlocal deliveries
    where the rider delivers the package directly from the pickup location to the
    drop-off location. P2H2P is used for intercity deliveries where the package is
    routed through a hub. P2H2P fulfillments require different packaging and an Air
    Waybill (AWB) number. This information is required for merchants to decide on
    the packaging required for shipment. /on_search

- question: What are forward and backward shipments?
  answer: 'Forward shipment is relatively simple: the logistics buyer provides the
    start and end locations for the order to be delivered. However, reverse shipment,
    also known as backward shipment, occurs when the buyer refuses the order or for
    any other reason does not want the product anymore. In such cases, the order or
    product needs to be returned to the place from which it was originally picked
    (RTO). /init & /on_init'
  tags:
  - Logistics Related Queries
- question: What is the payment object in the Init call?
  answer: In the /init call, the payment object specifies the payment method and the
    entity responsible for collecting payment from the end buyer, along with settlement
    details. If "collected_by" is BPP, the logistics service provider will handle
    payment collection, as seen in Cash on Delivery (COD) transactions. Within the
    settlement_details, information regarding the party with whom the payment needs

- question: What are cancellation_terms? Does this need to be sent? What if LBNP does
    not accept it?
  answer: 'During the pre-order flow, the Logistics Service Provider (LSP) defines
    the cancellation terms, which apply to cancellations initiated by either the LSP
    or the Logistics Buyer Network Participant (LBNP). These terms specify the fulfillment
    state at which an order can be canceled and the applicable charges based on the
    order’s status at the time of cancellation: If the order is canceled while in
    the pending state, no cancellation charges will be applied. If the order is canceled
    after pickup, agent assigned or while out for delivery, a 100% cancellation charge
    will be applied. If the LBNP does not agree with the defined cancellation terms,
    they have the option to reject (NACK) the /on_init or /on_confirm callback using
    error code 62505.'

- question: What are the instructions object in start and end object of fulfillment?
  answer: The instructions object within the start and end sections of a fulfillment
    provides clear pickup and delivery guidelines. This ensures a seamless process
    by guiding both the buyer and the delivery agent. Order verification is conducted
    using a Pickup Confirmation Code (PCC) at pickup and a Delivery Confirmation Code
    (DCC) at delivery.

- question: What is the difference between update and status call?
  answer: '1. Update Call: In logistics, the update call is primarily used to mark
    an order as ready to ship. Additionally, it can update authorization OTPs and
    linked order details. 2. Status Call: The /status call in ONDC logistics allows
    the logistics buyer app to request the current status of an order. In response,
    the logistics seller app uses the /on_status endpoint to provide the order''s
    current status. This communication helps keep the buyer app informed about the
    progress of their order.'

- question: What does the "breakup" section represent in the quote?
  answer: The "breakup" section provides a detailed breakdown of the total price into
    its constituent parts. Each part typically represents different components contributing
    to the total cost, such as delivery charges, taxes, etc.
  tags:

- question: How do cancellation terms vary based on fulfilment state?
  answer: Cancellation terms can differ based on the fulfilment state. Various stages
    of fulfilment may result in distinct cancellation fees or penalties. For example,
    cancelling an order while it's in a pending state may or may not involve any cancellation
    charges. However, once an agent is assigned or the order is picked up, cancellation
    charges may be incurred upon cancelling the order.
  tags:
  - Logistics Related Queries
- question: What is meant by "fulfilment state" in cancellation terms?
  answer: The fulfillment state represents the status of an order before cancellation,
    such as pending, agent-assigned, order-picked-up, or out-for-delivery. It helps
    determine the applicable cancellation terms based on the transaction stage.

- question: When can we initiate a search call for logistics?
  answer: If it is a cascaded flow, logistics search can be initiated after receiving
    a retail /select call. If it is an uncascaded flow, it can be initiated when LBNP
    wants to search for a logistics provider. B. Non cascaded flow is independent
    logistics flow. In non cascaded flow search calls are made after a retail order
    is confirmed. LBNP triggers search after order is placed. In /on_select seller
    sends estimated delivery charges. SNP have to procure logistics and bear the cost
    if estimated delivery charges are less as compared to charges sent by LSP in on_search

- question: What is the provider object in the search call?
  answer: 'The provider object in the search call for Logistics gives a rundown of
    the retail seller or the logistics buyer. It''s like a snapshot of their operational
    details. Here''s a breakdown: Availability: It tells you when the seller or Logistics
    Buyer Network Participant (LBNP) is open for business. This includes their working
    days and hours. Closures:  It specifies any holidays or planned closures for the
    seller/LBNP store. Preparation Time (Hyperlocal): For hyperlocal orders, the seller/LBNP
    can indicate how long it takes them to get an order ready. Example: Let''s imagine
    a grocery store using the ONDC network. Their provider object in a search call
    might look like this: "provider": { "id": "G12345", // Unique ID of the grocery
    store "time": { "days": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], // Open Monday to Saturday "schedule":
    [ { "from": "09:00", // Opens at 9 AM "to": "21:00"  // Closes at 9 PM } ], "holidays":
    [ { "from": "2023-12-25", // Closed on Christmas Day "to": "2023-12-25" } ] },
    "descriptor": { // ... other details about the store ... } } In essence, the provider
    object helps the buyer app understand the seller''s operational hours and plan
    the logistics accordingly.'

- question: What scenarios are required to be tested for log verification for B2C?
  answer: Test case scenario for B2C Link:- Q. After which retail API we can initiate
    a search request to logistics. Once the order is selected by the end user (buyer)
    in the /select call, the retail seller — now acting as the LBNP — can initiate
    the /search call to the LSP. Q. When can we initiate a search call for logistics?
    The /search call must be initiated by the LBNP (buyer) and sent to the gateway
    URL. The gateway will then broadcast this request to all sellers who can service
    the item or are available in the specified area. Below are the Gateway URL for
    each environment:- Staging:- https://staging.gateway.proteantech.in/search Pre-Production:-
    https://preprod.gateway.ondc.org/search Production:- Q. What does @ondc/org/payload_details
    tags defines @ondc/org/payload_details specifies the length, breadth, height,
    and overall dimensions of the packages to be delivered. It also includes the actual
    item price and its category, indicating whether the item is classified as a dangerous
    good or not. Q. What is forward and backward shippment? A forward shipment refers
    to the process where the logistics buyer (LBNP) provides both the pickup (start)
    and drop-off (end) locations to facilitate the delivery of an order to the end
    customer. This is the standard flow for delivering a product once an order is
    placed. On the other hand, a reverse shipment (also known as a backward shipment
    or return to origin - RTO) occurs when the end customer refuses to accept the
    order, cancels it after dispatch, or initiates a return for any reason (e.g.,
    damaged item, incorrect product, or no longer needed). In such cases, the logistics
    provider is responsible for picking up the product from the customer's location
    and returning it to the original seller's location or warehouse.
  tags:
  - Logistics Related Queries
- question: What is RTO initiated and RTO Disposed?
  answer: RTO (Return to Origin) is a key part of the order fulfillment lifecycle
    and involves multiple stages. Two critical states in this process are "RTO-Initiated"
    and "RTO-Delivered" or "RTO-Disposed". RTO-Initiated This state marks the beginning
    of the return-to-origin process. It is triggered when the forward delivery attempt
    fails due to reasons such as recipient refusal, an undeliverable address, or other
    valid causes. At this point, the item is prepared for return to its original pickup
    location. The timestamp recorded in this state represents the official start of
    the RTO process. The location typically reflects the last delivery attempt location,
    where the delivery failed. RTO-Delivered / RTO-Disposed These states indicate
    the closure of the RTO cycle. RTO-Delivered signifies that the item has been successfully
    returned to the original pickup location. The timestamp for this state marks the
    completion of the return journey. The associated location is usually the seller's
    warehouse or the origin point of the shipment. RTO-Disposed indicates that the
    item has been discarded instead of being returned. This usually applies to goods
    that are perishable, damaged, or otherwise not fit for return. The timestamp here
    marks the completion of the disposal process, and the location corresponds to
    where the item was disposed of. Q. On which call RTO can be initiated? RTO can
    be initiated in an unsolicited / solicited /on_cancel event. In such cases, a
    return (RTO) fulfillment entry will be added immediately after the original delivery
    fulfillment within the fulfillments array. This RTO fulfillment will include a
    timestamp indicating when the return process was initiated.

  - Logistics Related Queries
- question: What is meant by "fulfilment state" in cancellation terms?
  answer: 'The fulfillment state determines the applicable cancellation fee at each
    stage of the order. Based on the current fulfillment state, a specific cancellation
    fee may be charged. This information must be provided by the LSP. Q. What is the
    "Return" fulfillment type, and when is it used? A return-type fulfillment works
    just like the regular delivery flow, starting from the /search call and going
    through all the usual steps until the final API call. The only difference is that
    it clearly shows the item is being returned by the customer. In this case, the
    start location will be the customer''s address, and the end or delivery location
    will be the LBNP''s location or warehouse. Q. What is the purpose of Authorization
    in the start and end object of fulfillment? A.The authorization object within
    fulfillment/start defines the method used to authorize the pickup of an item,
    commonly referred to as the PCC (Pickup Confirmation Code). There are different
    enum values for PCC, such as: "2" – Merchant order number "3" – Other pickup confirmation
    code "4" – OTP "5" – Static OTP Q. What is the purpose of the @ondc/org/settlement_details
    tag, and in which call should it be sent? A. This tag contains all the settlement
    details, including information such as the settlement counterparty, settlement
    type, beneficiary name, UPI address, bank account number, and IFSC code. If the
    payment mode is UPI, the account number and IFSC code are not required. If the
    LBNP is the payment collector, then in the /on_init call, the LSP must provide
    their settlement details. If the LSP is the collector, then the LBNP must send
    their settlement details in the /init call. { "settlement_counterparty":"lbnp",
    "settlement_type":"upi", "beneficiary_name":"xxxxx", "upi_address":"gft@oksbi",
    "settlement_bank_account_no":"XXXXXXXXXX", "settlement_ifsc_code":"XXXXXXXXX"
    } Q. What is the purpose of Authorization in the start and end object of fulfillment?
    A. The authorization fields in the start and end sections specify the Pickup Confirmation
    Code (PCC) and Delivery Confirmation Code (DCC), respectively. These indicate
    the type of authorization required during pickup and delivery. Q. Is it mandatory
    to send ready to ship as yes in /confirm call only? A. This information must be
    sent by the LBNP once the order is ready to be shipped. If the order isn’t ready
    at the time of the /confirm call, the LBNP should update the order later by setting
    the "ready to ship" flag to yes in the /update call. Q. What is the cancellation
    reason code? A. The cancellation reason code indicates the specific reason for
    which an order is being cancelled. Each reason is associated with a unique code
    that must be provided when cancelling an order. Please refer to the links below
    for the list of reason codes. Cancellation reason code link:- Q. What is the timestamp
    in fulfillment inside the start and end object?  When does it need to be sent?
    A. The timestamp inside the start object represents the actual time the order
    is picked up. It should not be included before the pickup happens—only once the
    order has been picked up should this timestamp be provided. The same applies to
    the end object: its timestamp should only be included after the order has been
    delivered, either to the end customer or returned to the origin. Before delivery,
    this timestamp is not required. Q. What does the "price" section represent in
    the quote? A. The price field represents the total consolidated amount of all
    items listed in the breakup array. For example, if the breakup array includes
    four components—such as delivery charge, delivery tax, RTO charge, and RTO tax—the
    sum of all these individual amounts will be used as the final quote.price. Q.
    What range and durations define in search call A. The duration field represents
    the estimated order preparation time, indicating when the order is expected to
    be ready for shipment. This helps the LSP optimize task scheduling and resource
    allocation. The range field defines the time window for store order pickups. It
    means the store is available for pickups from 11:00 AM to 9:00 PM, Monday through
    Sunday. Eg:- "range": { "start":"1100", "end":"2100" } Q. Is it mandatory to send
    rto item in /on_search call? A.Yes, the LSP is required to provide details for
    both forward and reverse (RTO) shipment fulfillment. If the RTO item details are
    not included, the LBNP has the right to respond with a NACK. Q. What is the start
    and end object in fulfillment? A. The start location refers to where the order
    needs to be picked up, while the end location indicates where the order should
    be delivered. In the start object, if any form of pickup authorization is needed
    (like a pickup code), it will be included in the authorization field. Similarly,
    the end object will contain delivery-related details such as the delivery location,
    and if required, the delivery authorization information will also be present.
    Q. What does the reverse_qc tag represent? A. A reverse QC (Quality Check) online
    checklist may be provided when the fulfillment.type is set to "Return". This checklist
    helps ensure that returned items meet specific quality criteria before being accepted
    back into the system. It may include checks for item condition, packaging, completeness,
    and any visible damage. Providing this checklist allows for a more standardized
    and transparent return process, enabling the LSP or seller to make informed decisions
    about accepting or rejecting returned goods. Q. What is the timestamp in categories?
    A. The timestamp in the categories object indicates the estimated date of delivery
    for the order. It reflects the Turnaround Time (TAT) based on the delivery type—same
    day for Immediate Delivery (SDD), next day for Next Day Delivery (NDD), or an
    appropriate future date for other delivery categories. If the category_id is for
    Same Day Delivery, the timestamp should match the same date as the context.timestamp.
    For Next Day Delivery, it should be the following day. The same logic applies
    to other category IDs, with the timestamp reflecting the appropriate estimated
    delivery date accordingly. Q. In which case shipping labels need to be sent and
    on which call? A. A shipping label is required for orders with the P2H2P order
    type, but not for P2P orders. It can be shared either in the /on_confirm call
    by the logistics seller (LSP) or later in the /on_update call. Q. What is tracking
    url? A. A tracking URL can be provided in the /on_track call for P2H2P type shipment
    to allow tracking of the order. For P2P shipments, real-time updates must be shared
    using tracking.gps to enable live tracking of the shipment. Q. If return to origin
    is sent as no, So in such case what will happen? A. If "Return to Origin" is set
    to "no" and the order cannot be delivered to the end user—either due to refusal
    or any other reason—the item will be disposed of instead of being returned. Q.
    Is there any extra charge for RTO delivery? A. Yes, there is an additional charge
    for RTO (Return to Origin) delivery, which will be shared by the LSP in the /on_search
    call. If the item is cancelled and needs to be returned, this charge will later
    be included in the quote.breakup array in the /on_cancel call. Q. On_status call
    can be unsolicited or it can be only solicited? A. The /on_status call can be
    either solicited or unsolicited. If the buyer initiates a /status request, the
    LSP responds with a solicited /on_status call. However, in most cases, the LSP
    proactively sends unsolicited /on_status updates whenever there is a change in
    the fulfillment state — for example, when the order reaches the destination hub,
    is out for delivery, or has been delivered. Q. What is the provider array in the
    search call? A. The provider array in the /on_search response contains all the
    details shared by the LSP. This includes the provider''s descriptor (such as name
    and short description), fulfillment details for both forward and RTO shipments,
    the categories they serve, and the estimated delivery timelines. All of this information
    is included within the provider object. Q. Where is the new logistic api contract
    v1.2.5? A. Find below the new API contract for logistic domain v1.2.5 Link:- Q.
    If an item is out of stock, which call should be used to notify the seller with
    the latest item and packaging dimensions for delivery? A. If an item is out of
    stock, damaged, or cannot be delivered for any reason, the LBNP can send an /update
    call to inform the LSP with the updated item details, including its dimensions
    or packaging information. In response, the LSP may update the quote price if there
    are any changes in the item details or if the delivery charges need to be adjusted
    based on the new package dimensions. Q. Where is the new logistic api contract
    v1.2.0? A. Find below the new API contract for logistic domain v1.2.0 Link:- Q.On
    which call tracking can be enabled and disabled? A.The tracking status tag—either
    "enabled" or "disabled"—will be provided by the LSP in the /on_confirm call. This
    informs the LBNP whether tracking is available for the shipment or not.'

- question: Is it possible to have only cascaded logistics flow with retail?
  answer: Both cascaded and uncascaded logistics flows are possible. In a typical
    cascaded flow, a retail buyer selects items in the cart, and the Logistics Buyer
    (LBNP) searches for a logistics service provider (LSP) to fulfill the order. It
    receives multiple catalogs and initiates the logistics order with one of the LSPs.
    After the buyer confirms the order, LBNP confirms the logistics order. However,
    there is a possibility that the chosen LSP may delay pickup or cancel the order
    after confirmation. In such cases, LBNP can cancel the logistics order, cascading
    it back so that the seller can cancel the retail order. Alternatively, LBNP can
    search for another LSP and confirm the order with them. Non cascaded flow is independent
    logistics flow. Where an independent logistics buyer wants to buy logistics, and
    it should be implemented as per contract api calls.

- question: 'What is the transaction flow in RSF ?

    A: The image outlines the detailed transaction flow for Reconciliation and Settlement
    in a three-party setup: Collector, Settlement Agency, and Receiver. Here''s a
    brief explanation:'
  answer: '1. Settlement Phase:

    Collector & Receiver: Collector and Receiver both send the /settle call to the
    settlement  agency. Settlement Agency: Receives settlement instructions from both
    Collector and Receiver. Compare them to check for matching orders and amounts.
    If matched: proceeds to settlement. If mismatched: Share /on_settle with the status
    NOT_SETTLED with Collector & Receiver. 2. Mismatch Reconciliation Among NPs: This
    part deals with resolving mismatches between participants. Mismatch Process: Reconciliation
    /recon sent to counterparty. If mismatch is found: Counterparty reviews and responds
    with on_recon diff_amount flag. ​​'

- question: Could you offer detailed information about the field's inter_participant
    amount, provider amount, and self amount in the /settle API?
  answer: Self amount is the amount that is to be moved to the API caller's operative
    account Provider amount is the amount that is to be transferred to the provider's
    provided account
  tags:
  - Collector amount is what collector keeps for themselves
- question: Is the settlement process expected to be carried out on a daily basis,
    or does it depend on the mutual decision of the buyer and seller (as both need
    to send /settle to S.A)?
  answer: Settlement takes as agreed between the buyer app (collector) and seller
    app (receiver) viz. agreed through the settlement_window and settlement_basis
    attribute. The settlement cycle shall run once every day in the initial phase.
    Buyer Applications (Collector) are strongly suggested to send a daily /settle
    call, even if there are null settlements for the day to ensure deductions don’t
    happen based on the settlement call of the Seller Application (Receiver). In cases,
    Seller Applications (Receiver) sends a settle call for which there is no Call
    from the Buyer Application (Collector), money will get debited from the Collector.

- question: Could you please provide the details of the id field in the settlement
    object? Is this id will be the same for both the collector and receiver? Who is
    responsible for generating this id, and is it related to any payment ID?
  answer: '"settlement": { "type": "NP-NP", "id": "settlement-id-abc" } } settlement_id
    is the identifier of the settlement instruction shared by the respective NP. This
    is independent of the payment/ fund settlement or the counterparty NP. It is an

  tags:
  - Collector amount is what collector keeps for themselves
- question: What is the collector amount ?

    of the order. In retail context where retail buyer app is the collector, collector
    amount would refer to the buyer app’s finder fees commission
  tags:
  - Collector amount is what collector keeps for themselves
- question: What is self.amount?
  answer: Depending on who is calling the API - For buyer app's recon - self would
    be BFF - For seller app's recon - In case of SOR settlement, self would be seller
    app's margin. In the case of an entire settlement to SNP, self would be an inter

  answer: Settlements in the long term context, could be split into multiple phases
    (example 50% at the time of delivery and 50% at the time of return window expiry)
    hence provided as an array. Therefore the settlement object is an array, which

- question: What is the use of /Report, /On_Report APIs?
  answer: Report APIs can be used by the Collector or Receiver to know about the status
    of a settlement call from the Settlement Agency. The situation can arise due to
    edge case scenarios where the participant does not receive a /On_Settle call from
    the SA and therefore wants to know of the Settle Status. The caller of the API
    can mention the reference Transaction id and Reference Message id in the /Report

- question: What is the use of /Recon, /On_Recon APIs?
  answer: "The reconciliation process among the NPs are facilitated through the recon\
    \ and on_recon APIs. In case settlement instructions are shared to the settlement\
    \ agency and it fails for certain orders due an order mismatch or an order amount\
    \ mismatch, NPs shall leverage the recon and on_recon API to communicate the mismatches.\
    \ /recon:- In case an NP receives an order amount mismatch error code from the\
    \ settlement agency, the receiver initiates the /recon request to the collector\
    \ providing the breakup details for the respective order ID(s). \n/on_recon:-\
    \ The collector then reconciles and responds with the on_recon including the difference\
    \ amount after getting the recon call. In case an NP receives an order id mismatch\
    \ error code (i.e. order ID not shared by the counterparty), the NP is expected\
    \ to call the /recon API of the respective counterparty with the specific order\
    \ ID(s) and its breakup details. The counterparty then reconciles and responds\
    \ with details specific to the order id requested. In both cases, if the response\
    \ is correctly reconciled for the requisite orders, the settlement is initiated\
    \ in the next settlement cycle. Otherwise, NPs are expected to raise an IGM for\
    \ resolving the differences."

- question: I am a seller and there are unsettled orders with a buyer application.
    What should be my next steps to initiate reconciliation?
  answer: 'Steps to be followed are as follows: 1) Seller Application need to initiate
    recon API call to the respective buyer app(s) highlighting order level details
    including Order details such as Amount, Commission, With-holding amount, TDS and
    TCS 2) Buyer application needs to respond back with “on_recon” to either convey
    their agreement to seller application’s workings or reject the same a) If the
    “recon_accord” flag is true: Buyer Application agrees to the calculations of Seller
    application as per Recon API and requests the seller application to send a /settle
    call basis the same on the “Settlement Date” mentioned in the call. b) If the
    “recon_accord” flag is false: : Buyer Application disagrees with the calculations
    of Seller application as per Recon API and would send the order level calculations
    along with “diff_Value” wherever applicable. 3) Seller application basis the calculations
    can re-initiate the recon call, with the updated values if applicable and Step
    2 would restart. The Recon flow ultimately positively closes with Buyer Application
    (Collector) responding with “Recon_Accord” = True and provide settlement date
    Both Parties can at any stage raise an IGM complaint for resolution in case the
    recon, on_recon flow doesn’t provide a satisfactory resolution. Please find the

    A settlement basis is the event based on which the settlement is to be initiated
    at the time of settlement window. So, delivery as the settlement basis and 3 as
    the settlement window would mean the settlement instruction has to be sent on
    the 3rd day from the delivery date.'

  answer: The seller-side order is partially canceled. The buyer-side order is fully
    canceled. As a seller app, we need to understand how settlement and reconciliation
    are handled in these cases. Could you please provide guidance on this process?
    Typically, settlement of the order for now takes place after a terminal state
    in the retail domains, for example return window plus 7 days. Whether the order
    is seller side or buyer side cancelled is immaterial given fund movement will
    take place post a terminal state. For a completely cancelled order, if there are
    no cancellation charges, no settlement needs to be done For a partially cancelled
    order, the fund needs to be settled based on the remaining portion of the order
    quote.

  answer: The settlement cycle runs everyday. The /settle instruction needs to be
    shared with the settlement agency, by both buyer app and seller app, based on
    the settlement cycle agreed for the transaction (refer settlement_window and settlement_basis
    attributes). Buyer Applications (Collector) are strongly suggested to send a daily

    to also open an OCA account where “Self” money can be parked via instructions
    from the Settlement Agency. It is also therefore advised for participants to not
    link their NOCA account to their PA/PG till RSF 2.0 APIs are developed and tested
    by NBBL.

- question: I am an MSN Seller NP and have opted in for settling to my sellers via
    RSF 2.0, how would the money flow happen?
  answer: 'As an MSN Seller NP you need to mandatorily open a NOCA account with a
    bank supporting the same. Assuming the Buyer Application is the collector of money
    from the buyer, the settlement money flows from Buyer Applications NOCA account
    to your (Seller Application’s NOCA account) and the seller share moves from your
    NOCA to the sellers account mentioned in the Settle call sent to the Settlement
    Agency. Your share (Seller Application’s) moves from your NOCA to your Operative
    Current Account (OCA) as instructed to the SA:'

- question: In Flow 2, after "on_recon", if "recon_accord" is "true", when we reinitiate
    the settle request to the RSF Mock Server, do we need to send the settle request
    with the same transaction_id as the one used in Flow 2?.
  answer: If we do, we are not receiving the expected responses in the RSF Mock Server.
    Instead, a new RSF Server session is created. Could you please clarify whether
    the reinitiation of the /settle flow will be carried out in the new RSF Mock Server
    session with a new transaction_id?. you need to send the /settle request with
    a different transaction_id.

  - Refund Flow After Settlement
- question: How does the settlement process for the refund scenario occur in RSF 2.0?
  answer: In the RSF 2.0 (Revised Settlement Framework), how a refund is handled depends
    on whether the seller has already received the payment when the refund is requested.
    Let’s say a customer receives a damaged product and asks for a refund after the
    order has been delivered. If the settlement rule was based on “Order Delivered”
    and the seller was supposed to be paid within two days of delivery, then by the
    time the refund is requested, the seller might have already received the money.
    In this case, since the settlement window is closed and the seller has been paid,
    the refund process needs to follow a different path. The system has to manage
    the refund carefully and may even involve recovering the amount from the seller,
    depending on the situation. To understand exactly how this works—including the
    steps involved, which parties do what, and how the APIs support this process—you
    can refer to the    documentation.

- question: |
    What is to be used as a subscriber_id: http domain or some text id in a particular format?
  answer: |
    In Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC), the subscriber_id is a unique identifier associated with a network participant (such as a seller app, buyer app, logistics provider) during the onboarding process. It is typically the domain name or endpoint that uniquely identifies that participant within the ONDC network. The subscriber_id’s default value will be the Fully Qualified Domain Name of the subscriber unless specified otherwise as a network policy. (usually a domain format like ondc.seller.example) It is used in API requests to identify who is making the call, and appears in the context object of ONDC payloads. It is linked with authentication — used along with keys like unique_key_id (UKID) to sign and verify API requests. It is part of the ONDC Registry's Subscriber object which stores details of the participant. Buyer Apps (bap_id) and Seller Apps (bpp_id) in payloads are both subscriber_ids. { "context": { "domain": "nic2004:52110", "bap_id": "buyerapp.example.com", // subscriber_id of buyer app "bpp_id": "ondc.seller.example", // subscriber_id of seller app "timestamp": "2023-05-15T10:00:00Z" } }

- question: |
    If subscriber A needs to get the public key of Subscriber B when doing a transaction, then does it need to call lookup API to check whether Subscriber B exists?
  answer: |
    Yes, Subscriber A needs to call the lookup API to get the public key of Subscriber B and verify if Subscriber B exists in the registry. The lookup API only returns subscriber records that have status = "SUBSCRIBED" or “WHITELISTED”. Here's a detailed explanation: 1. Why Lookup? ONDC relies on public-key cryptography for secure communication. When Subscriber A wants to interact with Subscriber B, it needs Subscriber B's public key to verify signatures and ensure the message is from a trusted source. 2. Lookup API: The ONDC registry provides a lookup API that allows subscribers to fetch the public key of other subscribers using their `subscriber_id`. Link to lookup API 3. Active Status Check: The lookup API's response includes a "status" field indicating the subscriber's status. Subscriber A should check if Subscriber B's status is "SUBSCRIBED". This ensures that Subscriber B is active on the network and the communication will be successful. 4. Postman curl Example: curl --location 'https://prod.registry.ondc.org/v2.0/lookup' \ --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \ --header 'Authorization: Signature keyId="example-bap.com|bap1234|ed25519", algorithm="ed25519", created="<timestamp>", expires="<timestamp>", headers="(created)(expires)digest", signature="<signature>"' \ --data '{ "country": "IND", "domain": "ONDC:RET10" }'

- question: |
    I am facing a Signature verification issue with the Reference apps or Mock servers. How do I resolve this?
  answer: |
    Points to consider while generating signatures: One of the plausible reasons can be that you aren’t sending the same payload as you have used for the generating signature. For example, you have generated the signature with minify json. But when you are making a http request you have or your editor has beautified the payload. Secondly, make sure there are no escape characters added in the signature instead of space. After generating the signature, changing the context_timestamp to current time while making http request will receive NACK for Signature verification. It is not accepted if you make any change after generating the signature. Furthermore, You have added a wrong subscriber_id or unique_key while generating the signature. Make sure you put the signature in the Header as an Authorization key not in Bearer Token. While generating a signature through an endpoint as shown in the image below. It returns as json (stringified version) which means addition of escape characters. It is crucial to ensure the signature remains intact and free from any alterations.

- question: |
    As we are aggregating multiple buyers for multiple cities, the search gets initiated and every search result via the gateway results in 3 GB of data.
  answer: |
    Search should be initiated for each city and cached on your end. Since the catalog includes full details of the seller app/sellers and their serviceability, you may ingest, process, and cache it on your side. The buyer can then search directly from these cached results. As the number of seller NPs and sellers on the network grows, the volume of resultant data will also increase. Therefore, effective filtering and catalog rejection processes should be implemented to eliminate poor-quality catalogs or payloads.Also, please note that the /on_search response is sent directly to the buyer app’s endpoint and not routed through the gateway. /on_search

- question: |
    What are cancellation_terms? Does this need to be sent? What if LBNP does not accept it?
  answer: |
    During the pre-order flow, the Logistics Service Provider (LSP) defines the cancellation terms, which apply to cancellations initiated by either the LSP or the Logistics Buyer Network Participant (LBNP). These terms specify the fulfillment state at which an order can be canceled and the applicable charges based on the order’s status at the time of cancellation: If the order is canceled while in the pending state, no cancellation charges will be applied. If the order is canceled after pickup, agent assigned or while out for delivery, a 100% cancellation charge will be applied. If the LBNP does not agree with the defined cancellation terms, they have the option to reject (NACK) the /on_init or /on_confirm callback using error code 62505.

- question: What is forward and backward shippment?
  answer: |
    A forward shipment refers to the process where the logistics buyer (LBNP) provides both the pickup (start) and drop-off (end) locations to facilitate the delivery of an order to the end customer. This is the standard flow for delivering a product once an order is placed. On the other hand, a reverse shipment (also known as a backward shipment or return to origin - RTO) occurs when the end customer refuses to accept the order, cancels it after dispatch, or initiates a return for any reason (e.g., damaged item, incorrect product, or no longer needed). In such cases, the logistics provider is responsible for picking up the product from the customer's location and returning it to the original seller's location or warehouse.
  tags:
  - Key Concepts and Roles

- question: On which call RTO can be initiated?
  answer: |
    RTO can be initiated in an unsolicited / solicited /on_cancel event. In such cases, a return (RTO) fulfillment entry will be added immediately after the original delivery fulfillment within the fulfillments array. This RTO fulfillment will include a timestamp indicating when the return process was initiated.

    Steps to be followed are as follows: 1) Seller Application need to initiate recon API call to the respective buyer app(s) highlighting order level details including Order details such as Amount, Commission, With-holding amount, TDS and TCS 2) Buyer application needs to respond back with “on_recon” to either convey their agreement to seller application’s workings or reject the same a) If the “recon_accord” flag is true: Buyer Application agrees to the calculations of Seller application as per Recon API and requests the seller application to send a /settle call basis the same on the “Settlement Date” mentioned in the call. b) If the “recon_accord” flag is false: : Buyer Application disagrees with the calculations of Seller application as per Recon API and would send the order level calculations along with “diff_Value” wherever applicable. 3) Seller application basis the calculations can re-initiate the recon call, with the updated values if applicable and Step 2 would restart. The Recon flow ultimately positively closes with Buyer Application (Collector) responding with “Recon_Accord” = True and provide settlement date Both Parties can at any stage raise an IGM complaint for resolution in case the recon, on_recon flow doesn’t provide a satisfactory resolution.

  answer: |
    The bank account information of NPs will be provided to the settlement agency directly at the time of the settlement agency’s onboarding journey. This flow will be communicated subsequently very soon. NPs may reach out to the settlement agency’s POC for further details.

- question: |
    The documentation indicates that as a seller app, we need to call the /settle endpoint of the Settlement Agency to initiate the RSF settlement flow. Is there a predefined cycle for calling this method (e.g., every 7 days), or is this something we need to configure manually?
  answer: |
    The settlement cycle runs everyday. The /settle instruction needs to be shared with the settlement agency, by both buyer app and seller app, based on the settlement cycle agreed for the transaction (refer settlement_window and settlement_basis attributes). Buyer Applications (Collector) are strongly suggested to send a daily /settle call, even if there are null settlements for the day to ensure deductions don't happen based on the settlement call of the Seller Application (Receiver).

- question: Can I (a network participant) access my NOCA account for withdrawal of money?
  answer: |
    Money withdrawal from NOCA is only allowed by the instructions of the Settlement Agency. It is therefore mandated for every participant opening a NOCA account to also open an OCA account where “Self” money can be parked via instructions from the Settlement Agency. It is also therefore advised for participants to not link their NOCA account to their PA/PG till RSF 2.0 APIs are developed and tested by NBBL.

- question: |
    I am an MSN Seller NP and have opted in for settling to my sellers via RSF 2.0, how would the money flow happen?
  answer: |
    As an MSN Seller NP you need to mandatorily open a NOCA account with a bank supporting the same. Assuming the Buyer Application is the collector of money from the buyer, the settlement money flows from Buyer Applications NOCA account to your (Seller Application’s NOCA account) and the seller share moves from your NOCA to the sellers account mentioned in the Settle call sent to the Settlement Agency. Your share (Seller Application’s) moves from your NOCA to your Operative Current Account (OCA) as instructed to the SA:

- question: OCA account is not required for Seller NP. Right.?
  answer: |
    No, OCA (operative current account) is mandatory for Seller NP. This is where funds would be settled for the orders being transacted. This can be of any bank, no restrictions here.

- question: |
    In Flow 2, after "on_recon", if "recon_accord" is "true", when we reinitiate the settle request to the RSF Mock Server, do we need to send the settle request with the same transaction_id as the one used in Flow 2?.
  answer: you need to send the /settle request with a different transaction_id.

  - Reconciliation and Settlement Framework

- question: |
    As per the doc, we (receiver) need to respond on_recon immediately (solicited) with recon_accord status, BUT this is not possible. there may be a case when we need to review a request and provide on_recon as an unsolicited response later. So is this possible right now?
  answer: |
    TTL for on_recon provided in the examples are only placeholders. It would typically be around 5-7 days.

    What are actors in IGM 2.0.0? What roles do INTERFACING_NP and COUNTERPARTY_NP play?
  answer: |
    Actors in IGM 2.0.0 are participants involved in managing an issue, such as INTERFACING_NP and COUNTERPARTY_NP: INTERFACING_NP: Responsible for creating the complaint (for example buyer app) COUNTERPARTY_NP: Responsible for resolving the complaint (for example seller app)

- question: |
    How is the relationship between parent and child resolutions represented in the payload?
  answer: |
    A child resolution includes a ref_id pointing to a parent resolution, creating a hierarchy for more complex or alternative outcomes. This is used to provide multiple resolution options grouped together for the complainant to consume it accordingly

- question: |
    What is the relationship between actions and resolutions in the payload structure?
  answer: |
    Actions may reference resolutions to indicate whether they were accepted, rejected, or acknowledged by actors.

- question: What is the atomicity condition in multicart order confirmation?
  answer: |
    An order is only considered confirmed when all /confirm calls are acknowledged with valid /on_confirm responses. If any one of them fails or is not received within retry limits, all associated orders must be cancelled.
  tags:
  - General

- question: What happens if one of the /confirm requests fails?
  answer: |
    All associated orders in that transaction_id must be cancelled to maintain consistency and ensure that the buyer does not receive partial fulfillment.

- question: How will the buyer app receive order status updates for multicart?
  answer: |
    Through separate /on_status callbacks for each order_id, all carrying the same transaction_id. This allows mapping of updates back to individual carts in the multicart group.

- question: Can a single invoice be used across multiple domain orders?
  answer: |
    Yes, if items are fulfilled through a single logistics operation, the seller app may reuse the same invoice across /on_status callbacks.

- question: Can the buyer cancel only one part of the multicart order?
  answer: |
    Yes. Cancellations can be managed at the category/domain level using separate /cancel requests. However, full cancellations require multiple calls.

- question: How is cancellation propagated across related carts?
  answer: |
    Unsolicited /on_cancel should be sent for all reference order IDs, each reflecting updated quote and charges if applicable.

- question: How are returns managed in multicart?
  answer: |
    Returns are handled at the item or domain level using /update requests. Each return must be processed separately per domain/cart.

- question: How does quote adjustment work in multicart?
  answer: |
    If a cancellation or return in one cart affects logistics or pricing in another, unsolicited /on_cancel should be sent for each related order_id with updated quote_trail and quote objects.

- question: What if one of the seller apps doesn’t respond to /select or /confirm?
  answer: |
    The buyer app must implement a timeout and retry logic as per ONDC guidelines. If confirmation ultimately fails, initiate cancellation for all related orders.

- question: Can partial order confirmation be supported?
  answer: No. The multicart design mandates atomic confirmation—all or none must succeed.

- question: Is there a way to track if a full multicart was successful?
  answer: |
    Yes. Use the shared transaction_id to monitor status and confirmation of all associated order_ids.

- question: How should retry logic be handled in multicart confirm failures?
  answer: |
    Follow the same retry rules as single-order flows, but ensure that retries are tracked per cart and that global cancellation is triggered if retry limits are breached.
