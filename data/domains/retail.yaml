- question: The signature verification failed
  answer: "Reason: The issue occurs due to a mismatch between the payload and the\
    \ signing string, often caused by formatting or beautification, even if the payload\
    \ content is the same. Resolution: The JSON should be stringified before signing,\
    \ and the request body must be the exact lookup payload that was signed. Check\
    \ that the lookup payload and the signing string are exactly the same — without\
    \ beautification, extra spaces, or formatting changes. Minified JSON is preferred.\
    \ Implementation Guide: Process Walkthroughs The ONDC onboarding process begins\
    \ with key generation, where participants create a signing key pair using the\
    \ Ed25519 algorithm and an encryption key pair using the X25519 algorithm (in\
    \ ASN.1 DER format). Utilities for this are available in multiple languages such\
    \ as Java, Python, Node.js, PHP, and Go. Once the keys are generated, participants\
    \ move to endpoint setup, which includes generating a unique request_id, signing\
    \ it, and hosting the ondc-site-verification.html file at the appropriate URL\
    \ for domain verification. Additionally, the /on_subscribe endpoint must be implemented\
    \ and hosted to handle challenge decryption using a shared key derived from the\
    \ encryption keys. After these technical prerequisites are met, participants prepare\
    \ a /subscribe request that includes essential entity details such as subscriber\
    \ ID, callback URLs, public keys, and a unique key ID. The appropriate operation\
    \ type (e.g., Buyer App, Seller App, or both) is selected based on the participant’s\
    \ role. The final subscription request is then submitted to the ONDC Registry\
    \ endpoint corresponding to the relevant environment (Staging, Pre-Prod, or Production)\
    \ to complete the onboarding process. Once you receive an ACK response from the\
    \ Registry, your entity is successfully subscribed to the ONDC network. Once a\
    \ Network Participant (NP) successfully subscribes to the ONDC Registry, it can\
    \ perform a self-lookup to validate its presence in the network. This is done\
    \ by calling the /lookup API using its own subscriber_id. This journey is crucial\
    \ for NPs to verify whether their registration details (including subscriber type,\
    \ domain, city, signing/public keys, and endpoint URLs) are correctly recorded\
    \ in the registry. This also serves as a quick way to test connectivity with the\
    \ registry and confirm successful onboarding. The same lookup flow is used by\
    \ other participants (like gateways and seller apps) to retrieve public keys and\
    \ endpoint information for interaction and signature verification. To maintain\
    \ trust and ensure message integrity in the ONDC network, every request initiated\
    \ by an NP must include an Authorization header. This header is a cryptographic\
    \ signature created using the NP’s private signing key. The NP starts by generating\
    \ a digest of the request body using the BLAKE-512 hash function. Then, it appends\
    \ timestamp fields (created and expires) and constructs a signing string. This\
    \ string is signed with Ed25519 using the NP’s private key, and the resulting\
    \ signature is encoded in base64 and attached to the Authorization header. This\
    \ header is validated by the receiving NP (or Gateway), which retrieves the sender’s\
    \ public key using the /lookup API and verifies the signature before accepting\
    \ the request. This guarantees that the payload is authentic and untampered. In\
    \ a standard ONDC transactional flow such as /search, the Buyer App (BAP) initiates\
    \ a request to the Gateway. The Gateway first validates the Authorization header\
    \ by fetching the BAP’s public key using the /lookup API and performing signature\
    \ verification. It then validates the schema (specifically the context block)\
    \ and, if successful, signs the payload with its own private key, adding the X-Gateway-Authorization\
    \ header. The Gateway reads the domain and city from the context and broadcasts\
    \ the request to all eligible Seller Apps (BPPs) discovered via registry lookup.\
    \ After that, the flow becomes entirely peer-to-peer. Each Seller App validates\
    \ both headers, fetches public keys from the registry, and if the checks pass,\
    \ it processes the /search request. It then responds with a /on_search callback\
    \ sent directly to the Buyer App by appending /on_search to the subscriber_url\
    \ obtained via registry lookup. No further gateway involvement is needed after\
    \ the initial broadcast, making all subsequent communication directly between\
    \ network participants. Transactional Flow for IGM (Issue and Grievance Management)\
    \ Issue and Grievance Management (IGM) is a key component within the ONDC (Open\
    \ Network for Digital Commerce) ecosystem. It provides a structured and standardized\
    \ way for participants to raise, manage, and resolve disputes or issues that may\
    \ arise during or after an order is fulfilled. This could include problems such\
    \ as wrong items delivered, damaged products, delays, or payment discrepancies.\
    \ There are two versions of IGM that define how issues are handled: IGM 1.0.0\
    \ In IGM 1.0.0, the buyer is the only party allowed to raise an issue. The issue\
    \ is addressed by the seller (or the seller app), who is responsible for providing\
    \ a resolution. Issues can be raised at two levels: Item-level: Specific to a\
    \ particular item in the order (e.g., one item was damaged or missing). Fulfillment-level:\
    \ Related to the delivery or the overall order experience (e.g., delayed shipment,\
    \ incomplete order). The resolution process involves the seller responding with\
    \ possible actions like replacement, refund, or clarification. IGM 2.0.0 In IGM\
    \ 2.0.0, the process is bi-directional – meaning both the buyer and the seller\
    \ can raise issues. This version introduces greater flexibility and a more balanced\
    \ dispute resolution framework. Both parties (buyer and seller) have the ability\
    \ to: Raise an issue against each other. Respond to and resolve the issue. This\
    \ version supports a wider range of scenarios, including: Sellers raising issues\
    \ for fraudulent buyer claims. Buyers continue to raise issues related to order\
    \ problems. Issue resolution can still be based on the item or fulfillment level,\
    \ but now both parties can initiate and participate in the process actively. The\
    \ Journey of Financial Information Service (FIS) API The Financial Information\
    \ Service (FIS) API transforms the process of securing a personal loan into a\
    \ structured, transparent, and efficient journey. Through the open network, borrowers\
    \ and lenders connect seamlessly, guided by a series of well-defined steps facilitated\
    \ by the Borrower Platform (BAP) and Lender Platforms (BPPs). This narrative outlines\
    \ the journey, from the initial search for a loan to its final confirmation and\
    \ ongoing status updates, emphasizing clarity, trust, and technological precision.\
    \ Initiating the Search for Financial Opportunities: The journey begins when a\
    \ borrower, seeking a personal loan, engages the Borrower Platform (BAP). The\
    \ BAP initiates a search request, sending a query through the network’s gateway\
    \ to the registry. The registry identifies available Lender Platforms (BPPs) capable\
    \ of offering personal loan services. The gateway forwards the search request\
    \ to these BPPs, which respond with an on_search callback, publishing their loan\
    \ catalogs. These catalogs contain a variety of loan products, complete with details\
    \ such as loan types, interest rates, repayment terms, and eligibility criteria,\
    \ accessible via the Swagger Link. This transparent exchange opens a world of\
    \ possibilities, allowing the borrower to explore tailored financial solutions.\
    \ Exploring a Catalog of Loan Offers: Upon receiving the on_search response, the\
    \ BAP presents the borrower with a comprehensive catalog of loan offers from multiple\
    \ BPPs. Each offer is detailed, showcasing key information like interest rates,\
    \ loan tenures, and specific terms. This stage empowers the borrower to compare\
    \ options side by side, evaluating which loan aligns best with their financial\
    \ goals. The open network ensures that all relevant details are accessible, fostering\
    \ informed decision-making and eliminating the opacity often associated with traditional\
    \ loan searches. Selecting the Ideal Loan Product: With a clear view of available\
    \ options, the borrower selects a specific loan offer that meets their needs.\
    \ The BAP sends a select request to the chosen BPP, indicating the preferred loan\
    \ product. This action marks a pivotal moment in the journey, as the borrower\
    \ commits to pursuing a specific financial path, confident in their choice based\
    \ on the transparent information provided. Receiving Detailed Loan Information:\
    \ The lender responds with an on_select callback, acknowledging the borrower’s\
    \ selection and providing detailed information about the chosen loan product.\
    \ This response may include a dynamic form, prompting the borrower to specify\
    \ details such as the desired loan amount or repayment term. The BAP displays\
    \ this form to the borrower, ensuring a user-friendly experience as they input\
    \ the requested information, which is then relayed back to the BPP. This step\
    \ ensures the loan is tailored to the borrower’s unique requirements. Specifying\
    \ Loan Details: If a dynamic form is provided, the borrower completes it, entering\
    \ critical details such as the loan amount and preferred term. The BAP facilitates\
    \ this process, securely collecting and transmitting the information to the BPP.\
    \ This form (Loan Details) submission refines the loan offer, aligning it closely\
    \ with the borrower’s financial objectives and setting the stage for a formal\
    \ application. Formalizing the Loan Application: With the loan details submitted,\
    \ the BAP sends an init request to the BPP, formally initiating the loan application\
    \ process. This request includes the selected loan product, requested amount,\
    \ term, and any additional details gathered through the form. This step transitions\
    \ the journey from exploration to a structured engagement, signaling the borrower’s\
    \ intent to move forward with the chosen lender. Refining the Application with\
    \ Additional Information: The BPP responds with an on_init callback, acknowledging\
    \ the initialization and potentially providing additional dynamic forms to collect\
    \ further details. These forms may request Know Your Customer (KYC) information,\
    \ bank account details for loan disbursement, or e-mandate setup for repayments.\
    \ The BAP presents these form (KYC, Bank Details, e-Mandate) requirements to the\
    \ borrower, who completes and submits them. The lender also provides an initial\
    \ loan status update and may include additional terms, ensuring both parties are\
    \ aligned as the application progresses. Submitting Comprehensive Details: After\
    \ completing the additional forms, the BAP sends another init request, incorporating\
    \ the submission_id from the form submissions. This ensures all required information—KYC\
    \ documents, bank details, or e-mandate authorizations—is securely transmitted\
    \ to the BPP. The open network’s robust infrastructure guarantees that sensitive\
    \ data is handled with care, maintaining security and compliance throughout the\
    \ process. Processing and Updating the Application: The BPP processes the submitted\
    \ information and responds with an on_init callback, updating the loan application\
    \ status. This response confirms that the additional details have been received\
    \ and integrated, moving the application closer to completion. The borrower remains\
    \ informed through the BAP, which provides real-time updates on the application’s\
    \ progress, ensuring transparency and engagement. Reviewing the Loan Agreement:\
    \ As the application nears finalization, the BPP sends a form (Loan Agreement)\
    \ to the BAP, presenting the formal loan agreement for the borrower’s review.\
    \ This document outlines all terms, including interest rates, repayment schedules,\
    \ and responsibilities. The BAP displays the agreement, allowing the borrower\
    \ to review it carefully and provide an e-signature to indicate acceptance. This\
    \ step is critical, as it formalizes the borrower’s commitment to the loan terms.\
    \ Confirming the Loan Application: Once the borrower signs the loan agreement,\
    \ the BAP sends a confirm request to the BPP, finalizing the loan application.\
    \ This action solidifies the partnership between the borrower and the lender,\
    \ marking the successful completion of the application process. The open network\
    \ ensures that this confirmation is securely communicated, maintaining a clear\
    \ record of the agreement. Receiving Final Confirmation: The BPP responds with\
    \ an on_confirm callback, providing final confirmation details to the borrower.\
    \ This response confirms that the loan order is complete, and the loan is ready\
    \ for sanctioning or disbursement. The borrower receives clear communication through\
    \ the BAP, ensuring they understand the next steps, whether it’s awaiting funds\
    \ or activating repayment schedules. Monitoring Loan Status: Even after confirmation,\
    \ the journey continues with ongoing support. The BAP can send periodic status\
    \ requests to the BPP to check the loan’s progress—whether it has been sanctioned,\
    \ disbursed, or is in repayment. The BPP responds with updates, which the BAP\
    \ relays to the borrower, ensuring they remain informed at every stage. The open\
    \ network’s commitment to transparency ensures that the borrower is never left\
    \ in the dark, fostering trust and clarity throughout the loan lifecycle. Conclusion:\
    \ The journey through personal loan acquisition via the FIS API is a testament\
    \ to the power of open networks in revolutionizing financial services. By connecting\
    \ borrowers with lenders through a structured, transparent, and secure process,\
    \ the FIS API empowers individuals to make informed decisions, access tailored\
    \ solutions, and engage with confidence. From the initial search to ongoing status\
    \ updates, each step is designed to streamline the experience, build trust, and\
    \ deliver value. This journey is not just about securing a loan—it’s about empowering\
    \ borrowers to achieve their financial aspirations with clarity and control, supported\
    \ by a robust and innovative digital ecosystem. Logistic v1.2.5:- \nVersion Compatibility\
    \ for ONDC Protocol 1.2.5 introduces new baseline and enhanced features, detailed\
    \ in separate documentation:\n\n\n\nLSPs and LBNPs can selectively enable features\
    \ based on their business needs and must publish the features they support to\
    \ allow for mutual discovery. For APIs using these features, the context.version\
    \ must be set to \"1.2.5\". 1.2.5 builds upon 1.2.0: It's considered an incremental\
    \ update that layers new features over the base version 1.2.0. Compatibility Between\
    \ 1.2.0 and 1.2.5 General Backward Compatibility: Most APIs in version 1.2.5 are\
    \ backward compatible with version 1.2.0, allowing nodes (NPs) using version 1.2.0\
    \ to communicate seamlessly with those using 1.2.5.\n\nException – RTO Flow: The\
    \ updated RTO (Return to Origin) flow is not backward compatible with version\
    \ 1.2.0. Because of this, 1.2.5 and 1.2.0 are considered side-by-side compatible\
    \ rather than fully backward compatible.\n\nInteraction Scenarios:- An LBNP using\
    \ 1.2.0 may receive responses in either 1.2.0 or 1.2.5 from LSPs. An LBNP using\
    \ 1.2.5 may also receive responses in either 1.2.0 or 1.2.5.When responding with\
    \ version 1.2.5, the LSP must include the list of features it supports. An LBNP\
    \ using 1.2.5 can activate business workflows dynamically based on discovered\
    \ feature support from the LSP. Additional Notes:-Systems may implement a version\
    \ check for compatibility with \"1.2.*\" to support both 1.2.0 and 1.2.5 flexibly.\
    \ Transactional Flow for RSF (Reconciliation and Settlement Framework) Reconciliation\
    \ and Settlement Framework:- The Reconciliation and Settlement Framework (RSF)\
    \ governs how money flows between buyers, sellers, and other network participants\
    \ (NPs) on the ONDC network.  RSF 2.0 introduces a claim-based payout system where\
    \ both Buyer Apps (acting as Collectors) and Seller Apps (acting as Receivers)\
    \ submit their settlement details independently to the Settlement Agency (SA).\
    \ Here's a breakdown of the transaction flow: Standard Flow (Buyer App as Collector,\
    \ Seller App as Receiver, distinct legal entities): Order Placement and Payment:\
    \ A buyer places an order through a Buyer App and makes a payment.  The Buyer\
    \ App becomes the Collector of funds. /settle Call (Both Buyer and Seller Apps):\
    \ The Seller App (Receiver) sends a /settle call to the SA, claiming the amount\
    \ due to them (including their commission and any amount owed to the Seller on\
    \ Record). The Buyer App (Collector) also sends a /settle call to the SA, specifying\
    \ the order details and the amount to be settled. Order Matching and Reconciliation:\
    \ The SA matches the orders submitted by both the Buyer App and Seller App based\
    \ on order details. Balance Check: The SA checks if the Buyer App's account for\
    \ ONDC settlement has sufficient funds. Fund Transfer: If the balance is sufficient,\
    \ the SA instructs the banks to transfer funds: From the Buyer App's (Collector's)\
    \ account for ONDC settlement to the Seller App's (Receiver's) account for ONDC\
    \ settlement. From the Seller App's account for ONDC settlement to the Seller\
    \ on Record's bank account (if last-mile settlement is opted in by the Seller\
    \ App). From the Buyer App's (Collector's) account for ONDC settlement to the\
    \ Buyer App's (Collector's) operating account for the Buyer Finder Fee (BFF).\
    \ From the Seller App's (Receiver's) account for ONDC settlement to the Seller\
    \ App's (Receiver's) operating account for their commission. /on_settle (Settlement\
    \ Confirmation): The SA notifies both the Buyer App and Seller App about the successful\
    \ settlement, providing settlement reference numbers with status “SETTLED” or\
    \ “NOT-SETTLED”. Onboarding process with SA\nThe onboarding process with a Settlement\
    \ Account (SA) involves several steps for Network Participants (NPs) on the ONDC\
    \ network.NPs can reach out to the Settlement Agency (SA) via the contact email\
    \   provided on the ONDC website  . NPs are required to open an account for ONDC\
    \ settlement with banks onboarded on NPCI-NBBL NOCS. NPs are expected to follow\
    \ the following steps as per their respective role on the ONDC network. As a Buyer\
    \ App or Marketplace Seller App (MSN): On ONDC’s & SA’s  website, refer to the\
    \ published list of banks onboarded with SA Open an account for ONDC settlement\
    \ either with your existing bank, if it's on the published list, or with another\
    \ bank from the list Confirm that you have an account for ONDC settlement with\
    \ an SA on-boarded bank on ONDC’s NP portal Declare  on ONDC’s NP portal that\
    \ you have completed integration with SA Post go-live on the network, start making\
    \ claims to SA for receivables As an Inventory Seller App (ISN): Choose either\
    \ of the following options: Option 1: Follow steps 1 to 7 as mentioned above;\
    \ similar to Buyer App or Marketplace Seller App (MSN) Option 2: Alternatively,\
    \ follow the following steps- (A) If you will never be the Collector (take money\
    \ from the buyer directly) or will never take on-network logistics\n- don’t open\
    \ a new account for ONDC settlement with an SA on-boarded bank; and continue with\
    \ your existing bank account\n\n(B) If you will be the Collector (take money from\
    \ the buyer directly) or will take on-network logistics sometime in the future\n\
    - open a new account for ONDC settlement with an SA on-boarded bank; and continue\
    \ with your existing bank account Declare on ONDC’s NP portal that you have completed\
    \ API integration with SA Post go-live on the network, initiate receivables claims\
    \ by sharing /settle call(s) with SA Transactional Flow for Retail v1.2.0 1. Search\

- question: What is an incremental catalog refresh?
  answer: An incremental catalog refresh is a lightweight update mechanism that allows
    buyer Network Participants (NPs) to refresh their cached catalogs by receiving
    only the changes since the last full catalog update. This includes modifications
    such as item updates, store closures, or store deactivations, making the process
    more efficient than sending the entire catalog each time.

- question: What does ‘TTL’ mean in ONDC?
  answer: TTL (Time To Live) defines how long a message remains valid within the network.
    It ensures that requests are timely and relevant by setting an expiration duration.
    TTL is typically expressed in ISO8601 duration format — for example, PT30S represents
    30 seconds.

- question: What is the transaction trail of ONDC API calls?
  answer: Request is sent from sender to recipient; Recipient acknowledges the request
    by sending an "ACK" (or "NACK" if they cannot validate the request); Recipient
    sends response through the callback for the corresponding request API e.g. /on_search
    callback for /search request; Recipient of callback (could be the original sender)
    acknowledges the response by sending an "ACK" (or "NACK" if they cannot validate
    the request); The calls from are made in order (for pre- order stage) - /search,
    /select/, /init, /confirm

- question: What is Request incremental catalog refresh (pull)
  answer: 'Request Incremental Catalog Refresh (Pull) is a process where a system
    requests only the updated or changed parts of a catalog since the last update,
    instead of retrieving the entire catalog. The Buyer NP requests a one-time incremental
    refresh: start_time is before Context.timestamp, end_time is also before Context.timestamp,
    and end_time is after start_time (meaning the Buyer NP pulls incremental updates
    between start_time and end_time in a single solicited response).'
