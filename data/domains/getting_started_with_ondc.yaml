- question: What is ONDC?
  answer: ONDC (Open Network for Digital Commerce) is an Indian government-backed initiative aimed at democratizing digital commerce by enabling open, inclusive, and interoperable e-commerce eco-system. It allows buyers and sellers to connect across different platforms. Like UPI transformed digital payments, ONDC seeks to empower small businesses, local retailers, and consumers by providing equal access to digital markets. The network supports multiple apps for buying, selling, and logistics, ensuring transparency, lower costs, and wider choices.

- question: How Does ONDC Work?
  answer: |-
    Protocol-Based: ONDC uses open-source Beckn Protocol to standardize transactions.
    Interoperability: A seller listed on one app (e.g., Meesho) becomes visible on all ONDC buyer apps (e.g., Paytm).
    No Middleman: Sellers set prices, manage inventory, and choose logistics independently. ONDC works as an open network that connects buyers, sellers, and service providers (like logistics) through a common digital protocol, instead of relying on a single e-commerce platform. Participants (apps or businesses) join the network in roles such as: Buyer Apps – Used by customers to search and shop (e.g., Paytm, PhonePe) Seller Apps – Used by merchants to list products and manage orders Logistics Providers – Handle delivery across the network When a customer places an order on a buyer app, ONDC matches it with a seller and delivery provider from different platforms — all seamlessly integrated. This creates a decentralized and interoperable e-commerce system, much like how UPI enables payments between different banks and apps.

- question: Is ONDC a government app?
  answer: No, ONDC is not an app but a government-backed open protocol (like UPI for e-commerce). Private companies build apps (e.g., Paytm, Magicpin) that use ONDC’s network.

- question: Is ONDC Free to Use?
  answer: 'ONDC itself does not charge buyers or sellers for using the network. However, individual Network Participants (like Seller Apps, Buyer Apps, or Gateways) may apply their own fees for onboarding, transactions, or services. These fees are typically lower than those on traditional e-commerce platforms. Buyers:  Buyer Apps may apply convenience fees (if any). The actual costs depend on the participants you engage with, not ONDC directly.'

    What are the main roles in ONDC?
  answer: 'Network Participants (NPs) : These are entities that directly integrate with ONDC protocols (Beckn Protocol) and exchange protocol messages on the network. They are the core technical actors in ONDC. Ecosystem Participants: These are all other actors who enable, support, or benefit from the ONDC ecosystem.

- question: How to move from staging to pre-prod?
  answer: Firstly, the NP will have to give the demo for the staging environment. Once the  demo is done then they will have to get their subscriber_id whitelisted for pre-prod. For that, NP has to submit the request for whitelisting on the NP Portal. Once whitelisted, they can call the /subscribe API to get registered on Pre-prod.

- question: |
    What are cancellation_terms? Does this need to be sent? What if LBNP does not accept it?
  answer: |
    During the pre-order flow, the Logistics Service Provider (LSP) defines the cancellation terms, which apply to cancellations initiated by either the LSP or the Logistics Buyer Network Participant (LBNP). These terms specify the fulfillment state at which an order can be canceled and the applicable charges based on the order’s status at the time of cancellation: If the order is canceled while in the pending state, no cancellation charges will be applied. If the order is canceled after pickup, agent assigned or while out for delivery, a 100% cancellation charge will be applied. If the LBNP does not agree with the defined cancellation terms, they have the option to reject (NACK) the /on_init or /on_confirm callback using error code 62505.

- question: What is forward and backward shippment?
  answer: |
    A forward shipment refers to the process where the logistics buyer (LBNP) provides both the pickup (start) and drop-off (end) locations to facilitate the delivery of an order to the end customer. This is the standard flow for delivering a product once an order is placed. On the other hand, a reverse shipment (also known as a backward shipment or return to origin - RTO) occurs when the end customer refuses to accept the order, cancels it after dispatch, or initiates a return for any reason (e.g., damaged item, incorrect product, or no longer needed). In such cases, the logistics provider is responsible for picking up the product from the customer's location and returning it to the original seller's location or warehouse.

- question: How are multiple /select and /on_select calls handled?
  answer: |
    When the borrower selects a personal loan product, the lender platform initiates a consent request. Upon approval by the BAP, the lender shares the loan product, provider details, and customer identity. The lender may also return a form for further inputs, which the borrower completes and submits. This cycle can repeat with updated forms if needed.

- question: |
    The bap_id, bap_uri in /recon should be of the party triggering the /recon and the bpp_id, bpp_uri should be of the counter party receiving the /recon. Is this correct?
  answer: |
    No, the bap_id (buyer app id) and bpp_id (seller app id) should be the same for the /recon as per the core transaction itself, irrespective of which NP calls the recon API. This also works the same way for testing the recon flow in the mock server as well.

- question: Can we use either bap/bpp id or bap/bpp uri as the collector/receiver app id?
  answer: |
    The settle call’s collector/receiver app id is as per the collector and receiver pair for the order being executed among the NPs.

- question: |
    In the "settle" call of the Settlement Agency, how are taxes handled—does the collector deduct them before sending the "inter_participant" value, or is it inclusive, requiring sellers to handle deductions?
  answer: |
    The calculations are outside of the /settle call, the amount that needs to be sent from the collector to the receiver is provided as in the inter_participant amount and whatever is held by the collector is sent as part of the collector amount. Self is where the respective NP provides the amount to be transferred to their own operative account.

- question: |
    Do we need to include bank_details of both collector (debit from account) and receiver (credit to account) where to add both in /settle API, as the current payload only specifies adding the provider bank details?
  answer: |
    The bank account information of NPs will be provided to the settlement agency directly at the time of the settlement agency’s onboarding journey. This flow will be communicated subsequently very soon. NPs may reach out to the settlement agency’s POC for further details.

- question: OCA account is not required for Seller NP. Right.?
  answer: |
    No, OCA (operative current account) is mandatory for Seller NP. This is where funds would be settled for the orders being transacted. This can be of any bank, no restrictions here.

- question: |
    As per the doc, we (receiver) need to respond on_recon immediately (solicited) with recon_accord status, BUT this is not possible. there may be a case when we need to review a request and provide on_recon as an unsolicited response later. So is this possible right now?
  answer: |
    TTL for on_recon provided in the examples are only placeholders. It would typically be around 5-7 days.

- question: |
    How is the relationship between parent and child resolutions represented in the payload?
  answer: |
    A child resolution includes a ref_id pointing to a parent resolution, creating a hierarchy for more complex or alternative outcomes. This is used to provide multiple resolution options grouped together for the complainant to consume it accordingly
