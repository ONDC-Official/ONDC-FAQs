- question: What should developers know about managing keys on ONDC?
  answer: "ONDC requires all protocol messages to be signed using digital signatures.\
    \ Store private keys securely in .env files (never expose them in code repos)\
    \ Only public keys are stored in the Registry\n Best practice: Add .env to .gitignore\
    \ to prevent accidental commits of secrets."

- question: "What are logs in the context of ONDC, and how are they used? \n "
  answer: 'Logs are detailed records of requests and responses for all enabled APIs,
    captured during specific scenarios or workflows. They provide a comprehensive
    history of interactions between Network Participants within the ONDC network and
    are essential for debugging, validation, and certification.  For example:- TRV11,the
    logs can be validated using a POST request to the Log Validation Utility at https://log-validation.ondc.org/api/validate/trv/trv11.
    The structure for the validation payload is: { "domain": "ONDC: TRV11", "version":
    "2.0.0", "flow": "STATION_CODE", // or GPS or CANCEL "payload": { "search_1":
    {}, "on_search_1": {}, "search_2": {}, "on_search_2": {}, "select": {}, "on_select":
    {}, "init": {}, "on_init": {}, "confirm": {}, "on_confirm": {}, "status": {},
    "on_status": {} } } Each key in the payload corresponds to a specific API call
    and its response. For instance: "search_1" contains the initial Search request
    payload, "on_search_1" contains the corresponding on_search response from the
    seller app. The exact sequence and structure of API calls depend on the selected
    flow — such as "STATION_CODE", "GPS", or "CANCEL". For retail logs (version 1.2.0),
    a similar validation utility exists at https://log-validation.ondc.org/api/validate,
    with a different payload structure and available flows.  The logs for retail,
    IGM (Issue & Grievance Management), and RSF (Reconciliation and Settlement Framework)
    need to be submitted to a designated GitHub repository after self-testing.'

  answer: If we do, we are not receiving the expected responses in the RSF Mock Server.
    Instead, a new RSF Server session is created. Could you please clarify whether
    the reinitiation of the /settle flow will be carried out in the new RSF Mock Server

- question: How does the settlement process for the refund scenario occur in RSF 2.0?
  answer: In the RSF 2.0 (Revised Settlement Framework), how a refund is handled depends
    on whether the seller has already received the payment when the refund is requested.
    Let’s say a customer receives a damaged product and asks for a refund after the
    order has been delivered. If the settlement rule was based on “Order Delivered”
    and the seller was supposed to be paid within two days of delivery, then by the
    time the refund is requested, the seller might have already received the money.
    In this case, since the settlement window is closed and the seller has been paid,
    the refund process needs to follow a different path. The system has to manage
    the refund carefully and may even involve recovering the amount from the seller,
    depending on the situation. To understand exactly how this works—including the
    steps involved, which parties do what, and how the APIs support this process—you
    can refer to the    documentation.

  answer: Refs in IGM 2.0.0 are used to reference order details such as order, provider,
    fulfillment, item, etc., along with their respective IDs. These references help
    identify the order, provider, and item related to an issue. Mandatory Refs depend
    on the category of the complaint. Item category complaints required item object
    and fulfilment category complaints required fulfilment object.
